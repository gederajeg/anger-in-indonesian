This edition also includes new photographs, data on the most common rock types forming each volcano, information on population densities near volcanoes, and other features, making it the most comprehensive source available on Earth’s dynamic volcanism.},

As in an earlier study of emotion terms in American English (Shaver, Schwartz, Kirson, \& O'Connor, 1987), cluster analysis of sorting data collected in Indonesia revealed five basic-level emotion categories: cinta (love), senang (happiness), marah (anger), kawatir/takut (anxiety/fear), and sedih (sadness). Also in line with the American results, the five basic-level categories formed two large categories at the superordinate level: positive emotions and negative emotions. Each of the five basic-level categories contained several subordinate-level categories, totaling 31 in all. The results suggest that the emotion lexicons, and corresponding conceptualizations of the emotion domain, in Indonesia and the U.S.A. are similar at the superordinate and basic levels but somewhat variable at the subordinate level. This outcome \textendash{} like other kinds of psychological research on emotions and emotion concepts \textendash{} suggests that the gross structure of representations of the emotion domain are similar worldwide, perhaps for biological reasons, but that different cultures make different fine-grained distinctions and emphasize different subordinate-level emotion concepts.},

CFA (Confirmatory Factor Analysis) was used to analyse the data. The results of the study showed that based on the measurement model using CFA, CERQ totaling 36 items, through the item selection process, the remaining 17 items have high loading factor. Based on the results of the evaluation of the fit of model indicated by the parameters: chi square = 103.115 (p = 0.101), GFI = 0.895, AGFI = 0.814, CFI = 0.979, TLI = 0.967 and RMSEA = 0.044 explaining the existence of good  goodness of fit.  CERQ Indonesian version also has Composite Reliability (CR) in the range of 0.707-0.925 and AVE in the range of 0.786-0.927, also explaining and providing evidence of good convergent validity. The confirmed CERQ measurement model has a fit model according to empirical data. Thus, the Indonesian version of CERQ is accepted as a measure of emotion regulation, especially for young adult respondents (aged 20-40 years).},

Therefore, there is a need to study and explore the meaning and history of Gotong Royong. This study employs library research, which allows the use of references in the form of articles, books, and journals as its primary data of analysis. The result of this study is that Gotong Royong has existed since Before Christ (B.C.) to the present. The conclusion of this study is the expectation that Gotong Royong is continually maintained as the way of life for Indonesians because Gotong Royong is evident in Pancasila, Bhineka Tunggal Ika, and in living a democratic life},

Managing anger involves a complex interaction between thoughts, feelings, behavior, and physiology. Anger management is considered important from the perspective of psychology and an Islamic perspective, so it is essential to pay attention to the study of anger management in both perspectives. This study uses a systematic literature review method by examining anger management from psychology and Islam. The results show that anger management is seen in line with a psychological and Islamic perspective as an appropriate strategy to respond to anger to be something more positive and environmentally acceptable. However, in practice, the psychological perspective is more oriented towards controlling emotions through more general techniques such as behavior-changing techniques and cognitive restructuring. From an Islamic perspective, its application tends to lead to emotional control through spiritual activities such as ablution, dhikr, prayer, and reading the Al-Quran.},

	abstract = {Spiritual healing, also known as healing through prayer and meditation, has been widely studied by various scholars from different religions including Islam, Hindu, Buddhism and Christianity. The term spiritual medicine is increasingly popular with increasing mental disorders, degenerative diseases, metabolic, cancer and social illness such as drug abuse. Religions of Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity have almost the same tradition in the spiritual aspect to create purity of self and inner peace through the practice of worship or prayer based on spiritual meditation. The application of spiritual medicine is mostly done to reduce stress and anxiety due to illness suffered by the patient. Spiritual medicine is commonly used to peace building, study self-control, anger management, empathy, affection, calmness, and also to sharpen brain activity and increase well being. Spirituality refers to the process of improvement done with the aim to restore humans to the true figure as a God creation and have the correct perception about the true image of god based on the holy book of the Qur'an, Torah, gospel and the main figure of world religions such as the Buddha and prophet of Muhammad PBUH. All religions teach the need to ask the Creator to be healthy, prosperous and free from the sufferings of illness. The benefits of spiritual medicine depend on the quality, intensity and frequency or quantity of practices or methods that are practiced by each religious believer.},

	abstract = {Constructional analysis of corpus data can contribute to the analysis of a semantic frame, as demonstrated by a small corpus study of eat and feed. The EAT/FEED frame forms part of a taxonomy of frames including the superordinate CONSUME frame and subordinate frames of human vs. animal eating; constructional and metaphor data in the corpus shows that English covertly distinguishes human and animal eating. The EAT frame includes three phases (intake, process, and ingest), differentiated lexicogrammatically. The EAT frame also includes three domains in its domain matrix: physical, biological (nutritional) and social, all clearly differentiated by distinct constructions in the corpus. An examination of metaphors with eat and feed in the corpus demonstrate that the target domain contributes image-schematic structure to the metaphorical mapping, contrary to the Invariance Hypothesis.},

Since no translation or comparable corpora for this type of study are available for English and Spanish, the search engine Webcorp is used to research the occurrences of these terms in news texts via the web sites of a number of different English and Spanish newspapers. Our data reveal language-specific differences in the way in which both the synonyms and their respective translation equivalents participate in the metaphorical mappings found in each language.},

Particularly within cognitive and functional linguistics, the evolution towards a maximally dynamic approach to language goes hand in hand with a renewed interest in corpus research and quantitative methods of analysis. Many researcher feel that only in this wayone can do justice to the complex interaction of forces and factors involved in linguistic variability, both synchronically and diachronically. The contributions tothis volume illustrate the ongoing evolution of the field. By bringing together a series of analyses that rely on extensive corpuses to shed light on sociolinguistic, historical, and comparative forms of variation, the volume highlights the interaction between these subfields},

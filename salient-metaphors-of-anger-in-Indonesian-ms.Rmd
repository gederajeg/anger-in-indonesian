# Introduction {#intro}

Indonesian (or *Bahasa Indonesia*) is the standardised and official variety of the Malay language used in the multilingual society of Indonesia; the other standard forms of Malay also serve as the national languages of Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore [@tadmor_malay-indonesian_2009, 791]. Malay-Indonesian has the largest speakers in South-east Asia, with almost 280 million speakers combined in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei [@tadmor_malay-indonesian_2009, 791; @adelaar_dialects_2017, 571]. Genetically, Malay-Indonesian belongs to the Austronesian language family, particularly to "the Malayic subgroup of Western Malayo-Polynesian" [@tadmor_malay-indonesian_2009, 791; @adelaar_dialects_2017, 571]. For centuries, Malay-Indonesian has been the "lingua franca" in the regions and developed the colloquial varieties that exhibit great differences among themselves and with the standard language in many aspects of linguistic structures, from phonology to pragmatics [@tadmor_malay-indonesian_2009, 793]. This paper investigates the conceptualisations of [anger]{.smallcaps} in the standard Indonesian based on databases from the *Indonesian Leipzig Corpora* (hereafter ILC) collection [@biemann_leipzig_2007; @goldhahn_building_2012; @quasthoff_indonesian_2013], the Indonesian thematic thesaurus, the Indonesian WordNet, an Indonesian monolingual dictionary, and a bilingual Indonesian-English dictionary ([Section \@ref(method)](#method)).

## Previous studies on emotion concepts in Indonesian {#previous-study-emotion}

The EMOTION domain in Indonesian have been studied from the experimental psychological, ethnographical, and linguistic perspectives. Heider [-@heider_landscapes_1991] analysed large clusters of emotion concepts, including [anger]{.smallcaps} (see [Section \@ref(previous-study-anger)](#previous-study-anger)), based on 200 emotion words. The goals of Heider's study are twofold: (i) to map out the connection between emotion words of Minangkabau language spoken in West Sumatera and of Indonesian as spoken by the Minangkabau community and the Javanese community; and (ii) to identify prototypical scenarios of the emotions related to the behavioural correlates appropriate to various emotions, including the cause/antecedents and the outcomes/expressions of emotions. The study is based on a starter-list of Indonesian emotion words culled from dictionary, novels, and picture description task, and the synonyms of these words given by the respondents [@heider_landscapes_1991, 24-25]. The two points discussed by Heider provide important starting points for the lexical inventory and clusters of emotion words (both literal and figurative) and the cognitive models of the emotions based on different methodology. Heider's [-@heider_cultural_2011] follow-up study utilised open-ended interviews and focus-group discussion to gain richer data on the ethnographically complex construal of emotions clusters identified in Heider [-@heider_landscapes_1991] and situate them in the context of folk psychology. More recent anthropological linguistic studies of emotions in the regional, Austronesian languages of (Western and Eastern) Indonesia can be found in the collection of papers in Fox [-@fox_expressions_2018].

Shaver et al. [-@shaver_structure_2001] is a psychological study on Indonesian emotion lexicons. They adopt the prototype approach and cluster analysis (based on sorting task) to determine the hierarchical and family-resemblance structure of Indonesian emotion concepts, and compare them with findings from American English. Shaver et al. found that American English and Indonesian exhibit similarity in conceptualising the emotion domain and lexicons at the superordinate level (i.e., positive and negative emotion clusters) [-@shaver_structure_2001, 215-216] and basic-level categories (i.e., Indonesian's prototypical terms for the five basic-level categories of emotions refer to the same categories as in American English, namely *cinta* [love], *senang* [happiness], *marah* [anger], *kawatir/takut* [anxiety/fear], and *sedih* [sadness] [-@shaver_structure_2001, 218]).

There are several classic linguistic works on emotions in Indonesian/Malay and related languages. Matisoff [-@matisoff_hearts_1986] studies Sino-Tibetan languages of South-East Asian and highlights a subset of linguistic expressions that he calls "psycho-collocations" of emotions. These collocations are multiword, lexico-semantic metaphoric expressions referring to various kinds of mental activities and personhood, and which component parts are coming from body-part terms. Huang [-@huang_tsou_2002] investigates the psycho-collocation in Tsou, a Tsouic branch of the Austronesian family spoken in the highlands of Southwest Taiwan, and found that *koyu* 'ear' is the body part for the seat of cognition and feeling [@huang_tsou_2002, 171]. Extensive repertoires of psycho-collocations, especially for words referring to 'liver', can be found in Indonesian/Malay [@siahaan_did_2008;  @goddard_contrastive_2008; @oey_psycho-collocations_1990] and Iban (a Malayic language) [@sather_work_2018; @fox_towards_2018, 12]; liver is the prominent seat of feelings, cognition, and personhood in the Malay world. This study will offer some psycho-collocation data regarding to [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian.

Musgrave [-@musgrave_nonsubject_2001] and Mulyadi [-@mulyadi_verba_2012] are linguistic doctoral theses investigating emotion predicates in Indonesian. Based on observational data from an Indonesian novel, Musgrave [-@musgrave_nonsubject_2001] focuses on the syntactic properties of emotion predicates, particularly the grammatical status assigned to the second argument of emotion predicates, and the implication of such analysis to the *Lexical Functional Grammar* theory. One relevant insight from Musgrave's [-@musgrave_nonsubject_2001] study is the range of construction types in which an emotion predicate can occur, which is useful for the methodology used in this chapter in determining the nominal vs. non-nominal usage of [anger]{.smallcaps} predicate. Mulyadi's [-@mulyadi_verba_2012] dissertation is a contrastive semantic studies on emotion verbs between Indonesian and Asahan Malay variety spoken in Tanjungbalai (Asahan) area in the east coast of North Sumatera, Indonesia. Mulyadi uses a variety of methods for collecting the spoken and written data: introspection from the researcher, interview, and written texts of novels, newspapers, and dictionary of Indonesian (KBBI). Based on the *Role and Reference Grammar* and the *Natural Semantic Metalanguage* (NSM) theories, Mulyadi investigated extensive issues, namely (i) formal/syntactic and semantic parameters in determining the inclusion of emotion verbs; (ii) construction types of the emotion verbs in relation to the syntactic mapping of the experiencer (i.e., subject-experiencer, object-experiencer, and dative-experiencer) and the cause of emotions; (iii) categorisation of the emotion verbs (e.g., static vs. active emotion verbs); and (iv) sub-categorisation and meanings of the emotion verbs, based on the NSM explications. Mulyadi's [-@mulyadi_verba_2012] findings on the emotion lexicons and their semantic characterisation, especially on [anger]{.smallcaps}-like emotion, will offer important insights for the current study on the conceptualisation of [anger]{.smallcaps}.

Lastly, the Indonesian emotion concepts have also been analysed in terms of their metaphorical conceptualisations based on the *Conceptual Metaphor Theory* (CMT) [@siahaan_did_2008; @siahaan_why_2015; @rajeg_metafora_2013; @rajeg_metaphorical_2019]. Siahaan [-@siahaan_did_2008] examines the cultural conceptualisations and cultural models of the Indonesian word *hati* 'liver', which is the seat of emotion and cognition in the Malay/Indonesian culture. She proposes two underlying motives for the conceptualisations of Indonesian *hati* 'liver', namely the liver divination ritual and ethno-religious belief *hati* 'liver' as the locus for the living soul [see also @goddard_contrastive_2008 for a contrastive analysis of the conceptualisation of *hati* 'liver' in Malaysian Malay and the English *heart* from the NSM perspective]. Siahaan's [-@siahaan_why_2015] follow-up study investigates the figurative extensions of Indonesian terms for TEMPERATURE and found that emotion is a predominant extended sense of these terms. From the target-domain perspective, Rajeg [-@rajeg_metafora_2013] is the first study applying quantitative, corpus-based method to study metaphors for five Indonesian basic-level emotion concepts, including [anger]{.smallcaps} (see [Section \@ref(previous-study-anger)](#previous-study-anger)), based on self-compiled, literary corpus data. Rajeg's [-@rajeg_metafora_2013] analytical aspects include (i) identifying emotion-specific metaphors [@kovecses_emotionspecific_1998] using a statistical technique of *Configural Frequency Analysis* (CFA) [@gries_statistics_2009], and (ii) how these specific metaphors and their main meaning foci [@kovecses_metaphor_2010] semantically distinguish the emotions between one another. Rajeg [-@rajeg_metaphorical_2019] is a quantitative corpus-based study on metaphors for HAPPINESS near-synonyms that adopts the *MetaNet* approach to CMT [for a recent overview, see @oana_computational_2017; and the collection of papers in @petruck_metanet_2016] and *Metaphorical Pattern Analysis* (MPA) [@stefanowitsch_happiness_2004; @stefanowitsch_words_2006]. One of the themes in Rajeg's [-@rajeg_metaphorical_2019] study is investigating distinctive metaphors distinguishing emotion near-synonyms by applying *Multiple Distinctive Collexeme Analysis* (MDCA). Rajeg [-@rajeg_metaphorical_2019] identified that metaphors strongly distinguishing *happiness* and *joy* in English [@stefanowitsch_happiness_2004; @stefanowitsch_words_2006] are also amongst the metaphors strongly distinguishing the Indonesian equivalences of *happiness*, namely *kebahagiaan*, and of *joy*, namely *kegembiraan*.

## Previous studies on [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian {#previous-study-anger}
  
[Anger]{.smallcaps} concept in particular has also been part of the previous studies discussed in [Section \@ref(previous-study-emotion)](#previous-study-emotion). Heider [-@heider_landscapes_1991, 57, Table 7] found that figurative expressions (i.e., *palak* 'stifling; angry' and *panas hati* 'lit. hot liver; angry') received higher rating than the literal expression (i.e. *marah*) to represent [anger]{.smallcaps}, suggesting a potentially higher prominence of the figurative expressions of [anger]{.smallcaps}. Heider [-@heider_landscapes_1991, 24-25] also proposed four [anger]{.smallcaps}-like clusters in Minangkabau Indonesian: (i) "anger" clusters (*naik darah* 'lit. rising blood; angry'), (ii) "anger/cruel" clusters (*bengis* 'cruel; harsness'), (iii) "anger/dislike" clusters (*gemas* 'irritated'), and (iv) "anger/trembling" clusters (*gemetar* 'trembling'). The elicited scenarios from words belonging to the second, "anger/cruel" clusters revealed that the antecedents, or cause, of [anger]{.smallcaps} "are hurtful acts by others, especially naughty children, and the outcomes are physical violence and verbal abuse" [@heider_landscapes_1991, 80, 116]^[The cause of [anger]{.smallcaps} can also be fed by words in the "annoyance" clusters [@heider_landscapes_1991, 81]]. However, Heider [-@heider_landscapes_1991, 80] further noted that in the actual (rather than elicited) behaviour, Indonesians "mask most anger, and the open expression of anger is strongly disapproved of and negatively sanctioned". The Javanese Indonesian respondents describe the masking of [anger]{.smallcaps} more prominently than the Minangkabau Indonesian. It is interesting to see how prominent this expression/suppression aspect of [anger]{.smallcaps} is from the corpus study. Overall, Heider's [-@heider_landscapes_1991] study is a fundamental work in the study of cognitive model of [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian varieties as it provides inventory and relationship of the lexical items in the [anger]{.smallcaps} clusters [@heider_landscapes_1991, 252-258] and the cause-response scenarios of the [anger]{.smallcaps} clusters [@heider_landscapes_1991, 258-263] that can be further checked with corpus study.

Rajeg's [-@rajeg_metafora_2013, 211-213] Configural Frequency Analyses reveal that eight (out of the total 88) metaphors are significantly attracted to *amarah/kemarahan* 'anger' and six metaphors are significantly repelled by *amarah/kemarahan* 'anger'. The attracted metaphors are [controlling emotion is controlling a moving object]{.smallcaps} (N=75)^[The letter "N" inside a bracket represents observed, token frequency of a conceptualisation.], [emotion is pressurised substance]{.smallcaps} (N=95), [emotion is fluid in a container]{.smallcaps} (N=42), [emotion is heated fluid in a container]{.smallcaps} (N=30), [emotion is fire]{.smallcaps} (N=50), ([intensity of]{.smallcaps}) [emotion is temperature]{.smallcaps} ([hot/cold]{.smallcaps}) (N=16), ([intensity of]{.smallcaps}) [emotion is verticality]{.smallcaps} ([high/low]{.smallcaps}) (N=27), and [emotion is natural forces]{.smallcaps} (N=60). The six metaphors repelled by [anger]{.smallcaps} are [emotion is a possessable object]{.smallcaps} (N=23), [causing emotion is object transfer]{.smallcaps} (N=8), [emotion is an accidental motion]{.smallcaps} (N=0), [emotion is a journey]{.smallcaps} (N=0), [becoming emotion is finding an object]{.smallcaps} (N=0), and [emotion is liquid]{.smallcaps} (N=0) [-@rajeg_metafora_2013, 213-214]. The statistical attraction of [anger]{.smallcaps} to the [heat]{.smallcaps}- and [substance]{.smallcaps}-related metaphors in Indonesian seems to reflect the universality and centrality of these metaphors for [anger]{.smallcaps} as suggested in previous studies on different languages [see @kovecses_concept_2000 for details], including most notably English [@stefanowitsch_words_2006; @holland_cognitive_1987]. Most of the attracted metaphors semantically highlight the intensity of [anger]{.smallcaps}. The present study revisits Rajeg's findings via a combination of different methods, namely the lexical and corpus-based approaches as well as the metaphorical salience approach [@kovecses_salience_2015], which does not include comparison with other emotion concepts as in Rajeg's [-@rajeg_metafora_2013] and Stefanowitsch's [-@stefanowitsch_words_2006] studies. Rajeg's quantitative corpus-based study also fills a substantial gap from Yuditha's [-@yuditha_indonesian_2013] study on [anger]{.smallcaps} metaphors in Indonesian. Yuditha [-@yuditha_indonesian_2013] adopts the corpus-illustrated [@tummers_usage-based_2005] approach and does not provide a quantitative assessment for the specificity of certain metaphors that she introspectively proposed to be applicable to [anger]{.smallcaps} (compared to LOVE and HATERD). A follow-up, yet preliminary, quantitative corpus-based study of Indonesian [anger]{.smallcaps} is Rajeg [-@rajeg_metaphorical_2014], who uses a small sample of ten on-line newspapers retrieved via *WebCorp*^[*WebCorp* can be accessed via https://www.webcorp.org.uk/live/.] (CITATION). It investigates the distinctive metaphorical profiles of five [anger]{.smallcaps} synonyms. The metaphorical profiles are based on the distinctive metaphorical constructions [@stefanowitsch_words_2006] for each synonym identified via MDCA (CITATION). It is found that, overall, 'intensity' is the most prominent aspect highlighted by the metaphorical constructions across the synonyms.
  
## Aims {#aims}

This chapter presents new approaches in the study of [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian from the Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) and corpus linguistic perspective. It combines the updated version of the classic introspective/eclectic approach in CMT, namely the "lexical approach" [@kovecses_lexical_2019], with the corpus linguistic approach to metaphor and metonymy [see @stefanowitsch_corpus-based_2006 for an overview; and the collection of papers in @stefanowitsch_gries_2006]. Such combination is reflected in the recent salience-based approach [@kovecses_salience_2015] to measuring the prominent metaphor and metonymy for a given (emotion) target domain in a language (see [Section \@ref(method)](#method) for details of the salience-based approach). The inclusion of metonymy in this chapter fill the gap from previous works in Indonesian that focus only on metaphor [@yuditha_indonesian_2013; @rajeg_metafora_2013; @rajeg_metaphorical_2014]. Finally, this chapter will also discuss the role of contexts in metaphor and metonymy as highlighted in recent development of CMT [@kovecses_metaphormindcontext_2019]. Given the existing works on [anger]{.smallcaps} metaphors in Indonesian, we would expect some common theme in the types of metaphors for [anger]{.smallcaps}, but the new approach adopted in this chapter is expected to enrich the existing description of the conceptualisation of [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian.

The chosen Indonesian terms corresponding to the English "anger" are *marah* 'angry; anger'^[The English translations come from Stevens and Schmidgall-Tellings [-@stevens_comprehensive_2004].], *amarah*^[*Amarah* is the informal variant of *marah* as indicated by the official *Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia* (KBBI) *The Big Dictionary of Indonesian* and defined under the entry for *marah*: https://kbbi.kemdikbud.go.id/entri/marah (accessed on October 26, 2021).] 'anger', and *kemarahan* 'fury; rage; anger', which is the abstract noun derivative from the root *marah*. The choice is based on Shaver et al.'s [-@shaver_structure_2001, 217] experimental finding that *marah* emerges as the prototypical label for the [anger]{.smallcaps}-like category in Indonesian, as it is semantically broader and commonly used in everyday Indonesian. The suggested commonality of *(a)marah* is evident from the frequency data in the ILC. The combined frequency of occurrence of *(a)marah* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(root, lemma == "(a)marah"), n), big.mark = ",")`) is significantly the highest (*X*^2^~goodness-of-fit~=`r format(round(root_chisq$statistic, 1))`; *df*=`r root_chisq$parameter`; *p*~two-tailed~`r root_pvals`) compared to the other two terms identified by Shaver et al [-@shaver_structure_2001, 218, Table 4] belonging to the same [anger]{.smallcaps}-like category, namely *geram* 'furious; angry' (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(root, lemma == "geram"), n), big.mark = ",")`) and *berang* 'furious; fury' (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(root, lemma == "berang"), n), big.mark = ",")`), as well as to the other near-synonyms of *marah* namely *murka* 'wrath; anger; fury' (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(root, lemma == "murka"), n), big.mark = ",")`) and *gusar* 'angry; offended; annoyed' (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(root, lemma == "gusar"), n), big.mark = ",")`). Moreover, *ke**marah**an* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(ke_an, lemma == "kemarahan"), n), big.mark = ",")`) as the derivative of *marah* is also highly significantly the most frequent in ILC (*X*^2^~goodness-of-fit~=`r format(round(ke_an_chisq$statistic, 1))`; *df*=`r ke_an_chisq$parameter`; *p*~two-tailed~`r ke_an_pvals`) compared to the other derivatives based on the other roots, namely *ke**murka**an* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(ke_an, lemma == "kemurkaan"), n), big.mark = ",")`), *ke**gusar**an* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(ke_an, lemma == "kegusaran"), n), big.mark = ",")`), *ke**geram**an* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(ke_an, lemma == "kegeraman"), n), big.mark = ",")`), and *ke**berang**an* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(ke_an, lemma == "keberangan"), n), big.mark = ",")`).


The database for the type-based, lexical approach is culled from the Indonesian WordNet (version 1.0) [@bond_wordnet_2014]^[The Indonesian WordNet 1.0 is available open access online at http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/cgi-bin/wn-gridx.cgi?usrname=&gridmode=wnbahasa (last accessed on 22 January 2022.)], the monolingual *Kamus Bahasa Indonesia* (the Indonesian Dictionary) (hereafter KBI) [@kamus_bi_2008]^[I used the full and searchable PDF version.], the official *Tesaurus Tematis Bahasa Indonesia* (the Indonesian Thematic Thesaurus) (http://tesaurus.kemdikbud.go.id/tematis/)^[The thesaurus is compiled and maintained by the Language Development and Cultivation Agency of the Ministy of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia.], and a bilingual Indonesian-English dictionary [@stevens_comprehensive_2004]. The relevant linguistic expressions (word, phrases) were gathered as follows. From the Indonesian sources (WordNet, KBI, and the thesaurus), the three Indonesian [anger]{.smallcaps} words (*marah*, *amarah*, *kemarahan*) were used as the search terms. This approach allows me to determine which entries/expressions (words, phrases, proverbs, etc.) contain (one of the) [anger]{.smallcaps} terms in their definition. Next, these expressions were checked manually one by one for the conceptualisations (e.g., metaphor or metonymy) and the source domains evoked by looking at their meanings in the online *Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia* (hereafter KBBI) (the Big Indonesian Dictionary)^[I used KBI instead of KBBI because KBBI only outputs the brief definition of the three [anger]{.smallcaps} words but not the metaphorical/metonymical expressions related to them, which can be found through the linked thematic thesaurus in the entry. In contrast, the available full PDF version of KBI allows me to do a concordance-like search throughout the PDF file using the target [anger]{.smallcaps} terms, which may appear in the definition of an entry related to them. This is not possible in KBBI because the search field is only used for the headword, not the words contained in the definition of the headword. That way, we need to know *a priori* all expressions which definitions contain the [anger]{.smallcaps} words.] following the procedure of the *Metaphor Identification Procedure* (MIP) [@pragglejaz_mip_2007; @pragglejaz_mip_2010]. To gather the data from the bilingual Indonesian-English dictionary, the English terms "anger" and "angry" were entered in the search field of the PDF version of the dictionary, allowing me to find the Indonesian expressions which definitions/glosses contain the word "angry" or "anger".

The database for the token-based, corpus approach is taken from the sentence-based corpus files (total size = `r prettyNum(sum(leipzig_size$total_tokens), big.mark = ",")` word-tokens) in the Indonesian Leipzig Corpora (ILC) collection. ILC is chosen since, to the best of my knowledge, it is the only open access source to the largest collection of Indonesian texts^[The alternative is the Indonesian corpus in *Sketch Engine* (SE), which is also from online materials as in ILC. However, SE is a paid service to which I and the institution I work in do not have paid subscription.] and allows us to download the raw corpus files.
The sources of the ILC files mainly consist of randomly chosen websites (`r pull(filter(leipzig_size_sources, sources == "web"), perc_sources)`% of the total size) and online news (`r pull(filter(leipzig_size_sources, sources == "news"), perc_sources)`%), followed by the Wikipedia dumps (`r pull(filter(leipzig_size_sources, sources == "wikipedia"), perc_sources)`%) and a mixture of other sources (`r pull(filter(leipzig_size_sources, sources == "mixed"), perc_sources)`%).

Following the *Metaphorical Pattern Analysis* (MPA) [@stefanowitsch_happiness_2004; @stefanowitsch_words_2006], I generated 1000 random concordance lines for each *marah*, *amarah*, and *kemarahan* to begin with, before manually discarding the irrelevant hits (e.g., duplicates, the predicative and attributive uses of the root *marah*, and the literal uses of the expressions). Next, to identify the relevant pattern, the constructional, syntactic collocations of the target terms were manually determined, adopting the underlying method in the *MetaNet* (MN) project that combines MPA with the construction grammar and frame-semantic approaches to metaphor [@sullivan_frames_2013; @oana_computational_2017; see also @rajeg_metaphorical_2019 for a recent application of MN and MPA to HAPPINESS metaphors in Indonesian; and @brooke-rose_grammar_1958, for the classic study highlighting the interaction of grammar and metaphor]. These collocations become the potential source-domain lexical units (hereafter LU) co-occurring with the target-domain terms in the metaphorical expressions [@stefanowitsch_happiness_2004, 138; @sullivan_frames_2013, 3, 5]. The next step is to adopt the MIP procedure to determine whether the collocation of the target terms evoke metaphorical readings. It is determined as to whether the collocates' contextual meaning when co-occurring with the target-domain terms contrasts with their more basic contemporary meaning in other contexts, such that the "contextual meaning can be understood in comparison to the basic meaning" [@rajeg_metaphorical_2019, 64; cf. @pragglejaz_mip_2007, 3; @sullivan_frames_2013, 36]. I use KBBI to determine the basic meaning of the collocates with reference to MIP's features of basic meaning of an LU, namely "more concrete (what they evoke is easier to imagine, see, hear, feel, smell, and taste), related to bodily action, more precise (as opposed to vague), historically older, and are not necessarily the most frequent meanings" [@pragglejaz_mip_2007, 3]. These features correspond to the characteristics of metaphorical source domains in CMT [@kovecses_where_2015, 2]. An additional diagnostic to help determine the basic meaning of the LUs is a question proposed by Soriano [-@soriano_conceptualization_2005, 91]: "what exactly each expression 'was literally about'?". To illustrate, consider the following examples showing two different ways to convey the existence of [anger]{.smallcaps} (*kemarahan*).

(@kemarahan_terjadi) *Kemarahan Presiden Jokowi __terjadi__ saat meninjau Pelabuhan Tanjung Priok (...)* (ind-id_web_2015_3M: 1310067)^[At the end of the numbered example, the source of the example is given in the format "(corpus file name: sentence id)" as in (ind-id_web_2015_3M: 1310067).]

(@kemarahan_datang) *(...) kemarahan itu bisa saja __datang__ dalam waktu yang ditentukan (...)* (ind-id_web_2013_1M: 143884).

Example (@kemarahan_terjadi) is considered a literal token given the verbal collocate *terjadi* 'happen' represents an abstract event as its basic meaning and, in this collocation with [anger]{.smallcaps} (another abstract domain), *terjadi* is still understood in the abstract domain of [anger]{.smallcaps} [@croft_domain_2003, 192; @sullivan_frames_2013, 9; @rajeg_metaphorical_2019, 99]. In contrast, the collocation of *kemarahan* as the subject of the motion verb *datang* 'come' (@kemarahan_datang), which has a basic meaning in the domain of physical translational motion, induces the metaphorical "domain mapping" [@croft_domain_2003, 192] and interpretation of the verb in the [anger]{.smallcaps} domain [cf. @sullivan_integrating_2016, 147; @dancygier_figurative_2014, 135]. Such metaphoric interpretation of *datang* 'come' emerges due to mismatch between (i) the semantic-type constraint assigned to the semantic role of the subject of *datang*, which is prototypically an animate entity, and (ii) the filler of that role, namely an abstract entity [anger]{.smallcaps} that is literally unable to perform translational motion; in MN, this evocation of metaphorical interpretation of an LU is called "role type constraint violations" [@stickles_formalizing_2016, 194; cf. @sullivan_integrating_2016, 148; @brooke-rose_grammar_1958, 1]. Prior to the MN project, the principles of metaphor-domain evocation of certain linguistic elements in a grammatical construction (e.g., the subject-verb or verb-object constructions) have been described extensively by Sullivan [-@sullivan_frames_2013; -@sullivan_integrating_2016] in terms of the Cognitive Grammar [@langacker_essentials_2013, 199] notion of autonomy/dependence (A/D) alignment in grammatical construction [cf. @rajeg_metaphorical_2019, 63, 101, for the discussion on the relevance of A/D alignment and MPA]. This goes without saying that there are also unclear cases as to whether the tokens are metaphorical or literal; these were marked as "?" in the database and can be viewed in the supplementary materials **(CITATION/DOI of the REPOS)**.

Another aspect of the token-based, data collection is identifying multiple metaphorical patterns in a single concordance line given that the target-domain term can have more than one relevant syntactic collocation [@sullivan_frames_2013, 135-138; @musolff_variation_2014; @rajeg_metaphorical_2019, 63]. Consider example (@multiple_mpattern):

(@multiple_mpattern) *(...) kerusuhan itu merupakan __hasil dari__ amarah yang __menumpuk__ (...)* (ind_news_2010_300K: 83871)

From this one citation of *amarah*, two metaphorical patterns are relevant syntactically. The first one is the noun phrase (NP) *__hasil__ dari amarah* 'the *yield* of anger'. In this NP, the source-domain item *hasil* 'yield' is the head while the target-domain item appears as the complement of the modifying preposition phrase (PP) *dari* 'from'. The second relevant pattern is the relative clause construction *amarah yang __menumpuk__* 'anger that _piles up_/_amasses_' whereby the head noun is the target-domain term while the source-domain item is the verbal head *menumpuk* of the relative clause.

After identifying the metaphorical patterns, they are grouped thematically into their metaphorical source domains. This study adopts the insights of the *MetaNet* (MN) approach to CMT. MN attempts to formalise the central notions in CMT via semantic frames and grammatical constructions by (i) representing the metaphor-input domains as semantic frames, and (ii) viewing conceptual metaphor (hereafter metaphor) as unidirectional mappings from the source-domain frames and to the target-domain frames, including the mapping between the frame roles, that are mediated via the metaphorical grammatical constructions [@sullivan_frames_2013; @stickles_formalizing_2016; @croft_connecting_2009]. The closest English equivalence of the Indonesian metaphorical LUs in the metaphorical patterns is used as guidance to determine the relevant category of source-domain semantic frames in the English MN Wiki repository^[The *MetaNet* main page can be accessed at https://metaphor.icsi.berkeley.edu/pub/en/index.php/MetaNet_Metaphor_Wiki] of semantic frames^[The *MetaNet* frame repository is available at https://metaphor.icsi.berkeley.edu/pub/en/index.php/Category:Frame] [cf. @lopez_distinguishing_2011 for a similar Frame-Semantic approach in Spanish]. Such thematic grouping also takes into account the relevant categories postulated in previous studies on [anger]{.smallcaps} metaphors. Furthermore, the metaphorical mappings within a metaphor are postulated by making use of the frame roles available in a given MN frame entry (when available) or proposed anew based on the semantics of the source-domain LUs in the metaphorical patterns. For the metonymic source domains, they are determined by checking the expressions related to the folk theory of the physiological effects of emotion as proposed in previous works.

The *metaphorical salience* measure for a given metaphor in the token-based, corpus database takes into account three variables:

a. The percentage of the token frequency of a metaphor
a. The percentage of the number of types of metaphorical linguistic expressions (i.e., metaphorical patterns) of a metaphor
a. The percentage of the number of types of metaphorical mappings in a metaphor

The token frequency of a metaphor is derived from all occurrences of metaphorical patterns evoking a given metaphor; the percentage of the token frequency for a metaphor is calculated from the total number of metaphorical tokens of all metaphors in the database. The same procedure and logic is applied for calculating the percentages of the types of metaphorical linguistic expressions and the types of metaphorical mappings [see @kovecses_salience_2015, 344-346 for details].

The metaphorical salience measure in the database for the lexical, type-based approach only takes into account the number of types of metaphorical linguistic expressions and the number of metaphorical mappings for a given metaphor. It is because the focus of such an approach is to gather the range of types of metaphorical expressions evoking a given metaphor and the metaphorical mappings within the metaphor.

The analysis on the lexical approach database reveals `r nrow(metaphor_typebased_salience)` types of conceptual metaphors. [Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-type-based)](#metaphor-table-type-based) presents the source domains of the metaphors ranked order by their degree of metaphorical salience measure shown in the `Aggregate` column.

In [Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-type-based)](#metaphor-table-type-based), `r happyr::numbers2words(length(grep(" is ", metaphor_typebased_salience_print[[1]], perl = TRUE)))` metaphors are shown in full, both with the source and target domains because they are the more general metaphors.

### [Anger is fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps} {#animal-typebased}

```{r mapping-animal, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_animal <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "fierce")) %>%

The lexical database reveals that [anger]{.smallcaps} is most saliently conceptualised as [fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps}. The [anger is fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps} metaphor is evoked in `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_typebased_salience, "n_type", "fierce, captive")` lexical units manifesting `r happyr::numbers2words(get_salience_stats(metaphor_typebased_salience, "n_mapping", "fierce, captive"))` conceptual correspondences/mappings between [anger]{.smallcaps} and [fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps}:

key mappings:

- anger <- restrained/captive, fierce animal
- experiencer <- entity who restrains/makes captive the animal


The most productive mapping/correspondence (`r mapping_animal_discuss %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING2) %>% unique()`; type=`r mapping_animal_discuss %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu) %>% unique()`)

The second most frequent mapping (`r mapping_animal_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'deliberately')) %>% pull(MAPPING2) %>% unique()`; type=`r mapping_animal_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'deliberately')) %>% pull(n_lu) %>% unique()`)

The least frequent mapping (`r mapping_animal_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'regulating')) %>% pull(MAPPING2) %>% unique()`; type=`r mapping_animal_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'regulating')) %>% pull(n_lu) %>% unique()`)

The main meaning focus of this metaphor in the lexical approach is on aggressiveness of the angered person as reflected in the mapping "aggressive angry behaviour is aggressive animal behaviour" because this is the most productive mapping indicated by the highest number of lexical unit types.

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_heat_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'becoming')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_heat_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'becoming')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`


### [Intensity is verticality]{.smallcaps} {#verticality-typebased}

```{r mapping-verticality, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_verticality <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "verticality$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_verticality-scale)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_verticality_stats <- mapping_verticality %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_verticality_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'verticality$') %>% left_join(mapping_verticality %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_verticality_stats)
```

Total types for the [intensity is verticality]{.smallcaps} metaphor is `r pull(filter(metaphor_typebased_salience, metaphor == "intensity of anger is verticality"), n_type)` expressions evoking `r pull(filter(metaphor_typebased_salience, metaphor == "intensity of anger is verticality"), n_mapping)` mappings. The key mapping is intensity of `r mapping_verticality %>% filter(status == 'key') %>% select(MAPPING) %>% distinct() %>% pull(MAPPING) %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ") %>% paste(collapse = "; ")`.

The most productive mapping is `r mapping_verticality_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " -> ")` (type=`r mapping_verticality_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`):

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_verticality_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'upward motion')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_verticality_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'upward motion')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

Another mapping indicates a short-lived, low intensity anger since the linguistic expression conveys the idea that the anger does not reach the end point of the scale (*marah __tiada sampai__* 'short-lived anger; lit. anger not reaching end point of a scale')

The main meaning focus of this metaphor is on the increasing intensity of anger, not necessarily reaching the highest end of the scale. This is evident from the mapping's highest type-frequency for the lexical units evoking the [(caused) upward motion]{.smallcaps} frame. This same mapping, however, is the second most productive in the token-based dataset ([Section \@ref(verticality-tokenbased)](#verticality-tokenbased)), which instead focuses on [anger]{.smallcaps} reaching/being at the highest end of the intensity on the verticality scale. 

### [Anger is contained substance]{.smallcaps} {#contained-substance-typebased}

This is a short-hand label for the [emotion is substance in a container]{.smallcaps} metaphor. This is part of a larger network of the [substance]{.smallcaps}-related source frames family postulated in the database. The other source domain frames are [heated/hot fluid in a container]{.smallcaps} ([Section \@ref(hotfluid-typebased)](#hotfluid-typebased)) and [pressurised substance in a container]{.smallcaps} ([Section \@ref(pressurised-typebased)](#pressurised-typebased)). The difference between the [contained substance]{.smallcaps} and [heated/hot fluid in a container]{.smallcaps} or [pressurised substance in a container]{.smallcaps} is that the former does not highlight the heated and pressurised semantics of the frames. The intensity aspect in the [contained substance]{.smallcaps} domain is construed via the quantity of the substance and the expression of anger is construed via the externalisation of the substance.

```{r mapping-containedfluid, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_containedfluid <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "is substance in a container$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_contents/located-entity)") & LU != "darah muda", "key", "no"),
         status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "angry-person_container"), "key", status),
         status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger-level_substance-fullness-level)"), "key", status))
mapping_containedfluid_stats <- mapping_containedfluid %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_containedfluid_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'is substance in a container$') %>% left_join(mapping_containedfluid %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_containedfluid_stats)
```

Total types for the [contained substance]{.smallcaps} is `r pull(filter(metaphor_typebased_salience, metaphor == "anger is substance in a container"), n_type)` expressions evoking `r pull(filter(metaphor_typebased_salience, metaphor == "anger is substance in a container"), n_mapping)` mappings. The key mappings are `r mapping_containedfluid %>% filter(status == 'key') %>% select(MAPPING) %>% distinct() %>% pull(MAPPING) %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ") %>% paste(collapse = "; ")`.

The most productive mapping is `r mapping_containedfluid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)` (type=`r mapping_containedfluid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`):

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_containedfluid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'channel+ing')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_containedfluid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'channel+ing')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`


### [Anger is heated fluid in a container]{.smallcaps} {#hotfluid-typebased}

```{r mapping-hotfluid, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_hotfluid <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "heated")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "angry-person_container"), "key", "no"),
         status = if_else(MAPPING == "anger_(heated-)fluid", "key", status))
mapping_hotfluid_stats <- mapping_hotfluid %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_hotfluid_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'heated') %>% left_join(mapping_hotfluid %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_hotfluid_stats)
```

Key mappings: anger is heated fluid; angry person is the container.

The most productive mapping is `r mapping_hotfluid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type=`r mapping_hotfluid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`):

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_hotfluid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'heat\\-level')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_hotfluid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'heat\\-level')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

Another mapping indicates caused increasing intensity is heating up the fluid (*naik setum* 'steam/fume up').


### [Degree of control is object dimension]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-dimension, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_dimension <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "dimension$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "anger_entity"), "key", "no"))
mapping_dimension_stats <- mapping_dimension %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_dimension_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'dimension$') %>% left_join(mapping_dimension %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_dimension_stats)
```

The [dimension]{.smallcaps} source domain is based on the [size]{.smallcaps} frame in MN. The smaller the dimension/space of an entity, the harder the angered person controls the emotion. This is a different inference in the use of the frame in construing the intensity level of [anger]{.smallcaps}, which is only found in the corpus-based data.

The key mapping is anger <- physical entity

The prominent mapping is `r mapping_dimension_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type=`r mapping_dimension_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`)

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_dimension_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'narrow')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_dimension_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'narrow')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

### [Anger is natural force]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-naturalforce, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_naturalforce <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "natural force$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "anger_natural-disaster"), "key", "no"))
mapping_naturalforce_stats <- mapping_naturalforce %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_naturalforce_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'natural force$') %>% left_join(mapping_naturalforce %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_naturalforce_stats)
```

This metaphor mainly focus on the intensity of anger construed as the powerful extent of natural forces. This is based on the [natural disaster]{.smallcaps} frame in MetaNet.

Key mapping: anger <- natural disaster

The prominent mapping is on the reduction/ceasing of anger: `r mapping_naturalforce_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type=`r mapping_naturalforce_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`)

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'to cease')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'to cease')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

The other mapping is (`r mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'ceasing')) %>% pull(MAPPING2) %>% unique()`; type=`r mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'ceasing')) %>% pull(n_lu) %>% unique()`):

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'ceasing')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'ceasing')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

and intensity of anger is the intensity of the natural force (*angin-anginan* 'windy; capricious; unpredictable')


### [Anger is solid entity]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-solid, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_solid <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "rough, solid entity$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_entity|degree.of.solidity)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_solid_stats <- mapping_solid %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_solid_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'rough, solid entity$') %>% left_join(mapping_solid %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_solid_stats)
```


The key mappings are `r mapping_solid %>% filter(status == "key") %>% pull(MAPPING) %>% unique() %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ") %>% paste(collapse = "; ")`.

The other mappings are: `r mapping_solid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type=`r mapping_solid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`)

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_solid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'calmness')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_solid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'calmness')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

Other mapping is the reduction of [anger]{.smallcaps} as melting ice (*mencair* 'to melt').

### [Anger is (un)veiled object]{.smallcaps} {#hidden-typebased}

```{r mapping-hidden, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_hidden <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "veiled object$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "([(]un[)]hidden\\-object)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_hidden_stats <- mapping_hidden %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_hidden_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'veiled object$') %>% left_join(mapping_hidden %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_hidden_stats)
```

The key mapping is `r mapping_hidden %>% filter(status == "key") %>% pull(MAPPING) %>% unique() %>% str_replace_all("[-]", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")`. 

The predominant mapping is `r mapping_hidden_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type=`r mapping_hidden_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`)

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_hidden_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'hiding')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_hidden_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'hiding')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

The other mapping is expressing anger is unveiling a hidden object (e.g., cause to emerge) (*__menerbitkan__ amarah* '(of sun) to *raise* anger')

The metaphor relates to the social expression and degree of control of the experiencer to keep or expose the anger.


### [(Cause of) anger is annoyance]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-annoyance, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_annoyance <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "annoyance$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "([(]un[)]hidden\\-object)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_annoyance_stats <- mapping_annoyance %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_annoyance_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'annoyance$') %>% left_join(mapping_annoyance %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_annoyance_stats)
```

The central mapping is `r mapping_annoyance_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type=`r mapping_annoyance_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`)

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_annoyance_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'cause.of')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_annoyance_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'cause.of')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

The other mapping is `r mapping_annoyance_stats %>% slice_min(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type=`r mapping_annoyance_stats %>% slice_min(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`) (`r paste(paste("*", mapping_annoyance_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'person.causing')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_annoyance_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'person.causing')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`)

### [Anger is sleeping organism]{.smallcaps} {#awakening-typebased}

```{r mapping-sleeping, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_sleeping <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "sleeping organism$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_slepping\\-entity$)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_sleeping_stats <- mapping_sleeping %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_sleeping_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'sleeping$') %>% left_join(mapping_sleeping %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_sleeping_stats)
```

This metaphor construes [anger]{.smallcaps} as a calm, sleeping organism with the following mappings:

- anger <- sleeping organism
- causing anger <- awakening/fishing out the organism (*__membangkitkan__ marah* 'to _arouse_ one's anger')
- anger near the limit <- awaken entity (*__bangkit__ amarah* 'anger *rose*')

The [awakening]{.smallcaps} frame underlying this metaphor, and in combination with the [fierce animal]{.smallcaps} frame in [anger is fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps}, is reflected in the common Indonesian proverb for [anger]:

(@bangunkan_macan) *membangunkan macan tidur* 'to awaken a sleeping tiger'

Here, *membangunkan* 'to awaken; to wake s.b. up' and *tidur* '(a)sleep' evoke the [awakening]{.smallcaps} frame while *macan* 'tiger' evokes the [fierce animal]{.smallcaps} frame. The proverb highlights the danger of invoking anger out of a calm state.

### [Anger is possession]{.smallcaps}

This is not prominent metaphor in the database as it is realised by only one type (*ambil* 'take'), evoking the MN [gain possession]{.smallcaps} frame:

(@typebased_gain-possession) *Jangan __ambil__ marah* 'Do not _take_ the anger' (Stevens Schimdgal Tellings 2004: 30)

This example means that the person should stay calm by not taking the anger object into his/her possession. The mappings inferred from (@typebased_gain-possession) are as follows:

- anger <- possessable object
- experiencer <- (candidate) possessor
- becoming angry <- taking/gaining the possessable object

The low salience of [possession]{.smallcaps} family of metaphors for [anger]{.small} is not surprising given that a previous study [@rajeg_metafora_2013, 213-214] found that metaphors within the [possession]{.smallcaps} family are statistically repelled by [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian ([Section \@ref(intro)](#intro)).

### [Anger is darkness]{.smallcaps} {#darkness-typebased}

```{r mapping-darkness, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_darkness <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "darkness$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_darkness$)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_darkness_stats <- mapping_darkness %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_darkness_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'darkness$') %>% left_join(mapping_darkness %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_darkness_stats)
```

The [darkness]{.smallcaps} frame in the metaphor is used to assess [anger]{.smallcaps} as a negative state [cf. @stefanowitsch_words_2006, 77]. It is evoked by `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_typebased_salience, 'n_type', 'darkness')` types manifesting `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_typebased_salience, 'n_mapping', 'darkness')` mappings:

- anger <- darkness
- person being angry <- person('s body) being in darkness (`r paste(paste("*", mapping_darkness_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'dark.state')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_darkness_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'dark.state')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`)


(@typebased_darkness-1) `r metaphor_typebased %>% filter(str_detect(CM_BROADER, 'darkness'), LU == "kegelapan") %>% pull(CITATIONS)` (`r metaphor_typebased %>% filter(str_detect(CM_BROADER, 'darkness'), LU == "kegelapan") %>% pull(SOURCES)`: `r metaphor_typebased %>% filter(str_detect(CM_BROADER, 'darkness'), LU == "kegelapan") %>% pull(PAGE_LOCATION)`)


## Metonymy {#typebased-metonymy-salience-results}

In the lexical approach database, I identified `r sum(metonymy_typebased_salience$n_type)` metonymic expressions for [anger]{.smallcaps} grouped under `r nrow(metonymy_typebased_salience)` (conceptual) metonymies. These metonymies are rank-ordered in [Table \@ref(tab:metonymy-table-type-based)](#metonymy-table-type-based) by their number of metonymic expressions.

```{r metonymy-category-typebased}
physiological_response_regex <- "(body heat|internal pressure|redness|breathing|visual interference|body hair|teeth biting|foaming|speechless)"
metonymy_typebased_salience_category <- metonymy_typebased_salience %>% 
  mutate(category = if_else(str_detect(metonymy, physiological_response_regex), "physiological response", "social-communicative behaviour"))

physiology_type_1 <- metonymy_typebased_salience_category %>% 
  filter(category == "physiological response") %>% 
  mutate(meto_stats = paste("[", metonymy, "]{.smallcaps} (type=", n_type, ")", sep = "")) %>% 
  pull(meto_stats)
physiology_type_1_total <- paste("*TOTAL~type~=", sum(filter(metonymy_typebased_salience_category, category == "physiological response")$n_type),"*", sep = "")
physiology_type_1 <- c(physiology_type_1, physiology_type_1_total)

social_type_1 <- metonymy_typebased_salience_category %>% 
  filter(category != "physiological response") %>% 
  mutate(meto_stats = paste("[", metonymy, "]{.smallcaps} (type=", n_type, ")", sep = "")) %>% 
  pull(meto_stats)
social_type_1_total <- paste("*TOTAL~type~=", sum(filter(metonymy_typebased_salience_category, category != "physiological response")$n_type),"*", sep = "")
social_type_1 <- c(social_type_1, rep("", 2), social_type_1_total)

metonymy_typebased_category_print <- tibble(`social-communicative behaviour:` = social_type_1, `physiological response:` = physiology_type_1)
```


```{r metonymy-table-type-based}
metonymy_typebased_salience %>% 
  mutate(metonymy = paste("[", metonymy, "]{.smallcaps}", sep = "")) %>% 
  rename(Metonymy = metonymy,
         `Types:` = n_type,
         `% of all types` = n_perc_type) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Conceptual metonymies for [anger]{.smallcaps} (Type-based, lexical approach)")
```


The salience of each metonymy can only be measured in terms of the number of the metonymic expressions (i.e., its metonymic types), given the metonymies only involve a single mapping. The mapping is reflected in the naming of the metonymy in the form of [metonymic source domain is metonymic target]{.smallcaps} (or [x is y]{.smallcaps} for short), which is different from the naming for conceptual metaphor in the form of [metaphoric target domain is metaphoric source domain]{.smallcaps} (or [a is b]{.smallcaps} for short).

### [Strong/aggressive verbal behaviour for anger]{.smallcaps}

The type-based analysis reveals that [`r str_replace(pull(slice_max(metonymy_typebased_salience, order_by = n_type), metonymy), " for anger", "")`]{.smallcaps} is the most predominant metonymic source domain for [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian (*X*^2^~goodness~ ~of~ ~fit~=`r round(chisq.test(metonymy_typebased_salience$n_type)$statistic, digit = 2)`, *df*=`r chisq.test(metonymy_typebased_salience$n_type)$parameter`, *p*=`r format(chisq.test(metonymy_typebased_salience$n_type)$p.value, digit = 3)`), showing the largest inventory of metonymic expressions.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "verbal")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "verbal")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`


These expressions are mostly verbs encoding the manner of speaking that metonymically points to the internal, emotional state of the speaker. More specifically, when someone speaks in the manner expressed by these expressions, the hearer could infer that the speaker is angry.

### [Violent frustated behaviour for anger]{.smallcaps}

Linguistic expressions evoking certain actions/behaviours that arguably harsh and violent can be metonymically used to refer to [anger]{.smallcaps}. This is motivated experientially in that frustration often leads to anger, which then brings about some irrational, harsh, dangerous, or violent actions.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "frustated")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "frustated")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`

The metonymy is related to a more generic metonymy for emotion, namely [effect of emotion stands for emotion]{.smallcaps}.

### [Aggressive visual behaviour for anger]{.smallcaps}

This metonymy represents the externalisation of [anger]{.smallcaps} via the aggressive forms of visual and/or facial behaviours. This is shown by the presence of facial-related body-parts (e.g., mouth, eyes, face) in some of the metonymic expressions, or in the inherent meaning of the expressions.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "visual behaviour")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "visual behaviour")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`

### [Body heat for anger]{.smallcaps}

In the classic CMT literature [e.g., @holland_cognitive_1987], the increased body heat is one of the experiential motivations for the [heat]{.smallcaps}-related metaphor for [anger]{.smallcaps}, such as [anger is fire]{.smallcaps}. Such bodily experience is felt during an intense anger and becomes a metonymic source domain for construing [anger]{.smallcaps}.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "body heat")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "body heat")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`

The metonymy is related to a more generic metonymy for emotion, namely [effect of emotion stands for emotion]{.smallcaps}. The metonymic expressions relate to situation of someone experiencing heat in their body (e.g., *radang* 'feverish', *kegerahan* 'stifling heat') that can be used to refer to [anger]{.smallcaps}.


(@meradangkan) *manuver-manuver Rita yang berjuang dengan bendera Partai Berkarya cukup __meradangkan__ partai-partai lainnya, khususnya partai-partai besar seperti Golkar, PPP, PKB, PDIP, PAN atau Demokrat.* (https://www.metropolitan.id/2019/04/kunjungi-peternak-puyuh-di-akhir-kampanye/; last access: 5 February 2022)

### [Internal pressure for anger]{.smallcaps}

The linguistic expressions under this metonymy refer to different kind of internal bodily pressure, such as blood pressure, muscular pressure, and swollen chest.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "internal pressure")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "internal pressure")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`

### [Lip/teeth biting/pressing for anger]{.smallcaps} {#lip-biting-typebased}

This metonymy can be related to the issue of emotional control. Given intense internal pressure forcing the angered persons to externalise and react due to their anger, the action of biting/pressing the lip/teeth may accompany the persons effort to stay under control, and it is here metonymically used to indicate [anger]{.smallcaps}.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "biting")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "biting")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`

### [Redness in the facial area for anger]{.smallcaps}

Another physiological effect of [anger]{.smallcaps} is physiological change in the facial area, such as flushing or being livid. This bodily experience is then used to refer to [anger]{.smallcaps}.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "redness")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "redness")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`

As we can see, a different body part around the face can be involved, such as the ear (*telinga*).

### [Visual interference for anger]{.smallcaps} {#visual-interference-typebased}

This metonymy appears to become the bodily basis of the [darkness]{.smallcaps} metaphor for [anger]{.smallcaps} ([Section \@ref(darkness-typebased)](#darkness-typebased)). All the metonymic expressions capture the visual-perception interference as if the eyes are (seeing) dark; hence, inability to see and, by way of semantic extension, think rationally.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "interference")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "interference")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`

### [Breathing difficulty for anger]{.smallcaps}

Intense, excited anger can lead to intense and potentially difficult breathing. In Indonesian, expressions referring to the difficulty of breathing due to excessive heat and/or no fresh air are used metonymically to refer to [anger]{.smallcaps}.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "breathing")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "breathing")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`

### [Standing body hair for anger]{.smallcaps}

This metonymy might be thought of more relevant to [fear]{.smallcaps} rather than [anger]{.smallcaps}. However, in the Indonesian database, the expression related to body hair can also refer to [anger]{.smallcaps}. It is especially the case in the body-part where no body hair is (expected to) grow, namely the liver *hati*.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "body hair")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "body hair")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`

### [Caressing the chest for anger]{.smallcaps}

The situation where someone holds onto, or caresses, their chest as if holding something from getting out can refer to someone's effort to stay under control (i.e., being patient) from his/her anger state (cf. [Section \@ref(lip-biting-typebased)](#lip-biting-typebased)). The metonymic expression below also indicates that *dada* is a kind of container of [anger]{.smallcaps}.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "caressing")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "caressing")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`

### [Clenching fist for anger]{.smallcaps}

This metonymy can be interpreted as an issue of control or an expression of [anger]{.smallcaps} (e.g., ready to attack the wrongdoer with the punch/fist).

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "clenching")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "clenching")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`

### Types of the metonymies (type-based dataset) {#metonymy-category-typebased}

In general, the metonymies in [Table \@ref(tab:metonymy-table-type-based)](#metonymy-table-type-based) can be categorised into two broader categories: (i) social-communicative behaviours characteristic of anger and (ii) the associated physiological responses ([Table \@ref(tab:metonymy-category-table-typebased)](#metonymy-category-table-typebased)).

```{r metonymy-category-table-typebased}
metonymy_typebased_category_binomtest <- binom.test(sum(filter(metonymy_typebased_salience_category, category != "physiological response")$n_type), sum(sum(filter(metonymy_typebased_salience_category, category != "physiological response")$n_type), sum(filter(metonymy_typebased_salience_category, category == "physiological response")$n_type)))

metonymy_typebased_category_print %>% knitr::kable(caption = "Two types of metonymies of [anger]{.smallcaps} (type-based dataset)")
```

It can be observed that [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian is characterised predominantly by metonymies referring to the physiological responses in terms of their number compared to the social-communicative behaviour. However, the total number of types of metonymic linguistic expressions are still significantly higher for the social-communicative behaviour category (type=`r sum(filter(metonymy_typebased_salience_category, category != "physiological response")$n_type)`) than the physiological response category (type=`r sum(filter(metonymy_typebased_salience_category, category == "physiological response")$n_type)`) (*p*~Binomial~ ~two~~-~~tailed~`r pval_print(metonymy_typebased_category_binomtest$p.value)`).

# The number of metaphors in the corpus-based analysis (`r nrow(metaphor_salience)` types) is significantly greater than the number of metaphors in the type-based analysis (`r length(metaphor_typebased_salience$metaphor)` types) (*p*~Binomial~~,~ ~two~~-~~tailed~ = `r round(binom_test_metaphor_lexical_and_corpus$p.value, digits = 4)`).
```


From the corpus-based analysis, I identified `r nrow(marah)` tokens of metaphorical expressions/patterns (manifesting `r nrow(metaphor_salience)` metaphors) ([Section \@ref(tokenbased-metaphor-salience-results)](#tokenbased-metaphor-salience-results)) and `r nrow(metonymy_tokenbased)` tokens of metonymic expressions (manifesting `r nrow(metonymy_tokenbased_salience)` metonymies) ([Section \@ref(tokenbased-metonymy-salience-results)](#tokenbased-metonymy-salience-results)). These numbers are arrived at after manually discarding the literal, predicative, attributive, duplicated, and unclear cases from the total 3000 concordance lines across the three Indonesian [anger]{.smallcaps} terms (cf. [Section \@ref(method)](#method)).

From the total `r length(metaphor_typebased_salience$metaphor)` metaphors identified in the type-based, lexical approach ([Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-type-based)](#metaphor-table-type-based)), `r round((length(metaphor_in_all_database)/length(metaphor_typebased_salience$metaphor)) * 100, digits = 1)`% (i.e., `r length(metaphor_in_all_database)` metaphors) are also identified in the token-based, corpus approach ([Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-token-based)](#metaphor-table-token-based)). The metaphors identified only in the type-based analysis (ordered decreasingly by their salience) are `r paste(paste(paste("[", metaphor_in_lexical_only, "]{.smallcaps} (", metaphor_in_lexical_only_aggregate, "%; rank=", metaphor_in_lexical_only_ranking, ")", sep = "")[1:length(metaphor_in_lexical_only)-1], collapse = ", "), ", and ", paste("[", metaphor_in_lexical_only, "]{.smallcaps} (", metaphor_in_lexical_only_aggregate, "%; rank=", metaphor_in_lexical_only_ranking, ")", sep = "")[length(metaphor_in_lexical_only)], sep = "")`. The remaining `r round((length(metaphor_in_corpus_only)/nrow(metaphor_salience)) * 100, digits = 1)`% (`r length(metaphor_in_corpus_only)` types) of the token-based metaphors are absent from the type-based database. These results suggest that the corpus-based approach can complement the type-based, lexical approach by offering a higher likelihood to identify more metaphors.

The difference between the [heat]{.smallcaps} source domain in the type-based approach, and the [temperature]{.smallcaps} source domain postulated in the token-based approach is as follows. The former focuses on the characteristic of (easily) angered person as relatively always hot, reflected by the linguistic expressions that do not encode any reduction of the heat. Meanwhile, the latter highlights the dynamics of the intensity when feeling angry, which can be reduced (i.e., cooled off) or reaching highest temperature; this is supported by the linguistic expression referring to coolness. In the MN frame repository, [heat]{.smallcaps} is a different frame and considered as a perspective of the [temperature]{.smallcaps} frame, which covers the range of temperature scale (from hot to cold). The [heat]{.smallcaps} frame itself is also linked to the [cold]{.smallcaps} frame via "in scalar opposition to" relation.

## Metaphor {#tokenbased-metaphor-salience-results}

[Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-token-based)](#metaphor-table-token-based) present all metaphor types identified from corpus-based analysis.


```{r metaphor-table-token-based}

# knitr::kable(slice_max(metaphor_salience_print, n = 20, order_by = Aggregate), caption = "Top-20 source domains of [anger]{.smallcaps} ranked-ordered by their degree of metaphorical salience (token-based)")

# knitr::kable(filter(metaphor_salience_print, Aggregate > 5), caption = "Source domains of [anger]{.smallcaps} based on the token-based, corpus approach (Aggregate values > 5%)")

knitr::kable(metaphor_salience_print, caption = "Source domains of [anger]{.smallcaps} (Token-based, corpus approach)")
```

In the following sub-sections, I will discuss the top-20 metaphors in [Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-token-based)](#metaphor-table-token-based) to match with the similar number of metaphors found in the lexical, type-based approach ([Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-type-based)](#metaphor-table-type-based)). Just over half (i.e., `r round(length(metaphor_in_all_database_top20)/20 * 100)`%; N=`r length(metaphor_in_all_database_top20)`) of the metaphors in the top-20 list are shared between the two databases/approaches; they will be mentioned in their respective sub-sections. Then, the metaphorical mappings for each metaphor will be presented in the decreasing order of their type frequencies (i.e., their manifesting linguistic expressions) to ease the identification of the "main meaning focus" of the metaphor that "can be seen from the metaphorical linguistic expressions that **dominate** a metaphor" [@kovecses_metaphor_2010, 140, boldface is mine].


### [Anger is contained substance]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-containedfluid-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_containedfluid_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "is substance in a container$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(_located\\-substance)"), "key", "no"),
         status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "experiencer_container"), "key", status),
         status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(substance.fullness.level)"), "key", status))

```

This metaphor is shared with the type-based database. However, it is the most salient one in the corpus-based database but at the rank `r get_metaphor_salience_rank(metaphor_typebased_salience, metaphor_regex = 'is substance in a container')` in the type-based database.

- expressing anger is expelling/releasing/channelling substance out (at others) (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_containedfluid_token_stats, 'releasing')`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_containedfluid_token, 'releasing', lu_output = FALSE)`)

  <!-- - `r mapping_containedfluid_token %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% filter(MAPPING == "experiencing anger is the presence of object in a location") %>% count(LU, LU_GLOSS) %>% mutate(lu_gloss_n = paste("*", str_replace_all(LU, "<\\/?w>", ""), "* '", LU_GLOSS, "' (", n, ")", sep = "")) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% pull(lu_gloss_n) %>% paste(collapse = "; ")` -->

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_containedfluid_token, 'experiencing anger is the presence of object in a location', lu_var = "MP", gloss_var = "MP_GLOSS")`

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_containedfluid_token, 'hard$')`



### [Anger is fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps} {#animal-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-animal-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_animal_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "animal$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "anger_restrained-entity"), "key", "no"),
         status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "experiencer/other-emotion_restraining-entity"), "key", status))
mapping_animal_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_animal_token)
mapping_animal_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'animal$') %>% left_join(mapping_animal_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_animal_token_stats)
```


The [fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps} source domain is consistently sitting in the top-two of the salient metaphors across the databases. This clearly indicate the prominence of this conceptualisation of [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian. What differentiates this metaphor in the two databases is its main meaning focus indicated by the productivity of the mapping in the metaphor. In the type-based approach ([Section \@ref(animal-typebased)](#animal-typebased)), the linguistic expressions most predominantly highlight the aggressive behaviour of the animal (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_animal_stats, 'aggressive')`), while in the corpus-based approach, the predominant expressions evoke mapping concerning restraining the animal (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_animal_token_stats, 'restraining')`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_animal_token, 'restraining')`); this mapping is on the contrary the least prominent in the type-based approach (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_animal_stats, 'restraining')`).

Key mappings: anger <- restrained, fierce animal; experiencer (or other states) <- restraining entity

- regulating anger is restraining the animal (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_animal_token_stats, 'restraining')`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_animal_token, 'restraining', lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_animal_token, 'restraining')`

- expressing and losing control over anger is unleashing a captive (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_animal_token_stats, 'unleashing')`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_animal_token, 'unleashing', lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_animal_token, 'unleashing')`

- aggressive animal behaviour is aggressive anger behaviour (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_animal_token_stats, 'aggressive anger')`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_animal_token, 'aggressive anger', lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_animal_token, 'aggressive anger')`

- experiencing effect of anger is being attacked by animal (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_animal_token_stats, 'attacked')`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_animal_token, 'attacked', lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_animal_token, 'attacked')`
  
### [Anger is fire]{.smallcaps} {#fire-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-fire-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_fire_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "fire$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "anger_fire|angry.person_burning.object|anger.level_fire.intensity"), "key", "no"),
         status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "anger_fire") & str_detect(LU, "^<w>api<\\/w>$"), "no", status),
         MAPPING = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "anger_fire") & status == "no", "anger is fire", MAPPING))
mapping_fire_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_fire_token)
mapping_fire_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'fire$') %>% left_join(mapping_fire_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_fire_token_stats)
```

Similar to the [anger is fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps} metaphor, the [anger is fire]{.smallcaps} metaphor seems to be a prominent construal in Indonesian, given that it stays in the top-three list in the lexical ([Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-type-based)](#metaphor-table-type-based)) and corpus-based results ([Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-token-based)](#metaphor-table-token-based)). In terms of the main meaning focus, the [fire]{.smallcaps} metaphor in the two databases equally prominently focus on the intensity aspect, particularly the increased intensity of the fire given it has the greatest number of types of linguistic expressions compared to the other mappings. However, if the token frequency of the mapping is taken into account, the [fire]{.smallcaps} metaphor in the corpus data most frequently capture the cause of anger (token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_fire_token, 'causing', lu_output = FALSE)`) (cf. below).

Key mappings: anger <- fire; angry person <- burning/burnt object; anger level <- fire intensity

- the increased degree of anger intensity is the increased degree of fire (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_fire_token_stats, 'highest')`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_fire_token, 'highest', lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_fire_token, 'highest')`

- causing anger is igniting fire (i.e. set on fire) (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_fire_token_stats, 'causing')`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_fire_token, 'causing', lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_fire_token, 'causing')`

- latent intensity is potential open fire (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_fire_token_stats, 'latent')`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_fire_token, 'latent', lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_fire_token, 'latent')`

- ceasing anger is fire going out (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_fire_token_stats, 'ceasing')`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_fire_token, 'ceasing', lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_fire_token, 'ceasing')`

- anger is fire (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_fire_token_stats, 'anger is fire$')`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_fire_token, 'anger is fire$', lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_fire_token, 'anger is fire$')`

### [Anger is weapon]{.smallcaps} {#weapon-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-weapon-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_weapon_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "weapon$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "anger_weapon"), "key", "no"))
mapping_weapon_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_weapon_token)
mapping_weapon_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'weapon$') %>% left_join(mapping_weapon_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_weapon_token_stats)
```

The [weapon]{.smallcaps} metaphor is only identified in the corpus-based data. The main meaning focus of this metaphor in terms of the number of types manifesting the mapping is target of expression of anger is the wrongdoer or other people. Meanwhile, in terms of the token frequency of the mapping, the causation mapping is the most predominant (cf. below); but, given the high token frequency of the causation mapping, its linguistic realisation is relatively less varied compared to the target of anger's expression mapping, which has greater types despite its lower token.

Key mapping: anger <- weapon

- target of expression of anger is the wrongdoer or other people (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_weapon_token_stats, "target of expression of anger")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_weapon_token, "target of expression of anger", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_weapon_token, "target of expression of anger")`

- causing anger is pulling the trigger (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_weapon_token_stats, "pulling the trigger")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_weapon_token, "pulling the trigger", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_weapon_token, "pulling the trigger")`
  
- retribution/avenge to wrongdoing is punishing with the weapon (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_weapon_token_stats, "punishing|avenging")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_weapon_token, "punishing|avenging", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_weapon_token, "punishing|avenging")`
  
- anger is weapon (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_weapon_token_stats, "^anger is weapon$")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_weapon_token, "^anger is weapon$", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_weapon_token, "^anger is weapon$")`
  
- channelling anger is redirecting weapon to constructive goal (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_weapon_token_stats, "constructive")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_weapon_token, "constructive", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_weapon_token, "constructive")`

The [adversary/opponent]{.smallcaps} metaphor is not found in the type-based analysis despite its prominence in the literature on [anger]{.smallcaps} metaphor. While the predominant linguistic expressions of this metaphor arguably evoke the MN [physical combat]{.smallcaps} frame (type=`r pull(slice_max(opponent_frame_type, order_by = n_lu), n_lu)`; token=`r pull(slice_max(opponent_frame_token, order_by = n), n)`), closer investigation on the context of the data reveal that the hostile encounter is not always between the anger-opponent and the self/experiencer/emoter, as suggested in the literature. Construing [anger]{.smallcaps} as an opponent/adversary can be opponent/adversary for external, non-self entity (predominantly external victim of a directed, externalised anger) (`r sum(pull(filter(opponent_victim_token, str_detect(NOTES, 'external|state')), n))` instances of the total `r sum(opponent_victim_token$n)` tokens of this metaphor). There are `r unlist(tally(filter(opponent_victim_token, str_detect(NOTES, 'external|state|^anger', negate = TRUE)), n))` instances where the victim is the self. This variation in the combatant of anger indicates that the adversarial nature of anger can not only endanger the experiencers but also social entities around them. 

The main meaning focus of the metaphor is managing anger is winning over the opponent as well as experiencing anger is giving in/losing to anger. Both mappings share the same number of types though the former is lexically relatively more varied given its token frequency than the latter. That is, `r get_metaphor_mapping_ttr(mapping_adversary_token_stats, 'winning')`% of the `r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_adversary_token, 'winning')` tokens for managing anger is winning over the opponent mapping are expressed by different types (`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_adversary_token_stats, 'winning')`), while only `r get_metaphor_mapping_ttr(mapping_adversary_token_stats, 'losing')`% of the `r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_adversary_token, 'losing')` tokens for experiencing anger is giving in/losing mapping are expressed by different types (`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_adversary_token_stats, 'losing')`).

- experiencing anger is giving in/losing (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_adversary_token_stats, "losing")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_adversary_token, "losing", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_adversary_token, "losing")`

- managing anger is winning over the opponent (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_adversary_token_stats, "winning")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_adversary_token, "winning", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_adversary_token, "winning")`
  
- evading anger is being protected from the opponent (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_adversary_token_stats, "evading")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_adversary_token, "evading", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_adversary_token, "evading")`

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_adversary_token, "combating")`

### [Intensity is verticality]{.smallcaps} {#verticality-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-verticality-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_verticality_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "verticality$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(_vertical.entity|_verticality.scale)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_verticality_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_verticality_token)
mapping_verticality_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'verticality$') %>% left_join(mapping_verticality_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_verticality_token_stats)
verticality_frame_stats <- happyr::get_frames("verticality$", df = marah, frame_var = "SFRAME", metaphor_var = "CM_BROADER", lexunit_var = "MP")
```

The [intensity is verticality]{.smallcaps} is shared between the type-based (rank=`r get_metaphor_salience_rank(metaphor_typebased_salience, 'verticality$')`) and token-based approaches (rank=`r get_metaphor_salience_rank(metaphor_salience, 'verticality$')`), at least in the top-10 most salience metaphors. This metaphor is based on lexical units referring to several MN frame families, namely [(caused) upward/downward motion]{.smallcaps}, [scale]{.smallcaps}, incorporated as a frame role in [verticality]{.smallcaps} frame, and [being at a high location]{.smallcaps}. The predominant frame of all the tokens of the metaphor is the [(caused) upward motion]{.smallcaps} frame (type=`r sum(filter(verticality_frame_stats, str_detect(frames, 'upward'))$type)`; token=`r sum(filter(verticality_frame_stats, str_detect(frames, 'upward'))$n)`). Together, all these frames and their lexical units highlight the dynamics of the intensity as movement or position of the [anger]{.smallcaps}-entity along the verticality scale. 

The [verticality]{.smallcaps} metaphor has `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, "n_type", "verticality$")` types of metaphorical pattern evoking `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, "n_mapping", "verticality$")` mappings.

Key mappings: anger <- vertical-entity; intensity <- verticality-scale

The two predominant mappings refer to (i) the entity reaching/being at/heading to the peak/highest point on the scale and (ii) the lifted position of the entity along the scale, without implying whether such upward motion of the anger-entity would reach the peak of the scale. The complete mappings and their metaphorical patterns are shown below.

- highest intensity is entity being at/going up to/reaching the highest end of the scale (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_verticality_token_stats, "^highest")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_verticality_token, "^highest", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_verticality_token, "^highest")`

- increasing intensity is (caused) upward motion (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_verticality_token_stats, "caused")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_verticality_token, "caused", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_verticality_token, "caused")`

- reduced intensity of anger is low on the scale (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_verticality_token_stats, "reduced")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_verticality_token, "reduced", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_verticality_token, "reduced")`

- intensity of anger is verticality scale (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_verticality_token_stats, "is verticality scale$")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_verticality_token, "is verticality scale$", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_verticality_token, "is verticality scale$")`

- maintaining anger is balancing the scale (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_verticality_token_stats, "balancing")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_verticality_token, "balancing", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_verticality_token, "balancing")`

In the type-based dataset, the [verticality]{.smallcaps} metaphor is the only basic and generic metaphor for highlighting the intensity of anger. Meanwhile, in the token-based dataset, there are several other basic metaphors for intensity.

### [Anger is confinement/impediment]{.smallcaps} {#confinement-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-confinement-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_confinement_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "impediment$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_impediment|angry.person_confined.entity)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_confinement_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_confinement_token)
mapping_confinement_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'impediment$') %>% left_join(mapping_confinement_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_confinement_token_stats)
confinement_frame_stats <- happyr::get_frames("impediment$", df = marah, frame_var = "SFRAME", metaphor_var = "CM_BROADER", lexunit_var = "MP")
```

This metaphor highlight the undesirability and difficulty aspect of being in the state of anger. This is not attested in the type-based dataset.

From a variety of frames. Some of them are within the [motion impediment]{.smallcaps} frame family in the MN repository, such as [confinement]{.smallcaps} and [barrier]{.smallcaps} (sub-cases of the [motion-affecting properties of the landscape]{.smallcaps} frame), [restraints]{.smallcaps} (a sub-case of the [motion-affecting objects]{.smallcaps} frame). Another is the [hiding]{.smallcaps} frame, especially lexical unites referring to enclosing/encompassing the experiencer (that is generically related to the [containment/bounded-region]{.smallcaps} frame), and several tokens of lexical units evoking the [motion with respect to an undesirable entity]{.smallcaps} frame.

```

This metaphor is a sub-case of the generic [object event-structure] metaphor, namely [attributes are possessions]{.smallcaps} [@lakoff_philosophy_1999, 195-196, 198]. It has `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, 'n_token', 'possession')` and `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, 'n_type', 'possession')` manifesting `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, 'n_mapping', 'possession')` mappings. The key mappings in the metaphor are (i) anger is the possession and (ii) angry person (or non-self entity, such as utterances, events, or even God) is the possessor or carrier of the object.

The entailed mappings from these two are as follows:

- feeling/experiencing anger is having/keeping/carrying possession (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_possession_token_stats, "keeping")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_possession_token, "keeping", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_possession_token, "keeping")`

- being scolded is obtaining an object (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_possession_token_stats, "scolded")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_possession_token, "scolded", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_possession_token, "scolded")`

- expressing anger to others is giving object (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_possession_token_stats, "expressing anger to others")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_possession_token, "expressing anger to others", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_possession_token, "expressing anger to others")`

- not experiencing anger is losing/giving away possession (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_possession_token_stats, "not experiencing")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_possession_token, "not experiencing", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_possession_token, "not experiencing")`

Most of the metaphorical patterns (i.e., `r pull(filter(possession_framefamily_stats, frame_category == "possession"), perc_n)`% of the metaphor token) evoke the [possession]{.smallcaps} frame family (type=`r pull(filter(possession_framefamily_stats, frame_category == "possession"), type)`; token=`r pull(filter(possession_framefamily_stats, frame_category == "possession"), n)`), namely [possession]{.smallcaps} itself and [transfer scenario]{.smallcaps}, the roles of which also make use of the [gain possession]{.smallcaps}, [lose possession]{.smallcaps}, and [giving]{.smallcaps}. The remaining tokens are metaphorical patterns evoking frames within the [affected motion]{.smallcaps} family such as [bringing]{.smallcaps} (e.g., *__membawa__ node* '_carry_ anger') and [object propulsion]{.smallcaps} (e.g., *__membuang__ node* '_throw away_ anger').

The inference from having/keeping the possession clearly refers to the experience of anger, and when the possessor/self loses the anger-possession as if being taken away, the self no longer feels angry. Next, the sentential context of the pattern evoking the gaining and giving the possession is not necessarily and inherently causing the recipient to become angry akin to the giver. Instead, gaining/getting or being given anger from the possessor means that the recipient becomes the target of expression of the angry person presumably because of the wrongdoing of the recipient/target of transfer (i.e., the recipient becomes the target of scolding, which may or may not lead to the recipient becoming angry later on). This inference is different from when the mapping is used in a more positive states, such as [happiness]{.smallcaps} where giving or getting happiness suggests causing happiness or becoming happy [@stefanowitsch_happiness_2004; @rajeg_metaphorical_2019].

### [Anger is submerged entity]{.smallcaps} {#submerged-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-submerged-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_submerged_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "submerged")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "_"), "key", "no"))
mapping_submerged_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_submerged_token)
mapping_submerged_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'submerged') %>% left_join(mapping_submerged_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_submerged_token_stats)
submerged_frame_stats <- happyr::get_frames("submerged", df = marah, frame_var = "SFRAME", metaphor_var = "CM_BROADER", lexunit_var = "MP")
```

This is a generic, [motion]{.smallcaps}-based metaphor capturing the way anger metaphorically exist and it is not attested in the type-based dataset. This is slightly different from the [(un)veiled object]{.smallcaps} metaphor ([Section \@ref(unveiled-tokenbased)](#unveiled-tokenbased)) where anger already exists and that highlights the issue of whether the experiencer is keen to show/unveil the anger to others or not (i.e., hiding it) [cf. @rajeg_metaphorical_2019, 158]. Compared to the other metaphors discussed so far, [anger is submerged entity]{.smallcaps} is rather conventionalised in its linguistic realisation, given it is manifested by small number of types (`r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, 'n_type', 'submerged')`) making up the high token of the metaphor (`r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, 'n_token', 'submerged')`); that is, only `r get_meta_freq_profiles('submerged', type_per_token_lu, df = ttr_metaphor_tokenbased, metaphor_var = "cm_broader")[[2]]`% of the metaphor's token are of different types that are repeated many times.

The key mapping is `r get_key_mappings(mapping_submerged_token)`. From this mapping, two entailed mappings are postulated based on the semantics of the source-domain frame lexical units.

- experiencing anger is the presence/emergence/protruding of the entity (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_submerged_token_stats, "protruding")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_submerged_token, "protruding", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_submerged_token, "protruding")`

The [sleeping organism]{.smallcaps} metaphor, also attested in the type-based dataset in the lower rank (i.e. `r get_metaphor_salience_rank(metaphor_typebased_salience, "sleeping")`) ([Section \@ref(awakening-typebased)](#awakening-typebased)), is based on the [awakening]{.smallcaps} frame in the MN repository in combination with the [caused upward motion]{.smallcaps} frame. The utilised aspect of the source frame is to cause the inactive and calm organism to become active/alert (e.g., being awake and aroused), or to indicate the active/awaken state of the organism. The manner of the awakening/alerting can be fishing for the organism via bait. In the target frame of [anger]{.smallcaps}, this is mapped onto the causal aspect for the presence of anger. This metaphor could be considered as a pre-condition for the existing danger and fierceness of the organism (i.e., anger) that need to be restrained as highlighted in the [fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps} metaphor ([Section \@ref(animal-tokenbased)](#animal-tokenbased)). The [sleeping organism]{.smallcaps} metaphor is proposed in Stefanowitsch's [-@stefanowitsch_words_2006, 76-77] corpus study on [anger]{.smallcaps} in British English. 

Key mapping: `r get_key_mappings(mapping_sleeping_token)`

- causing anger is fishing/awakening the calm entity (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_sleeping_token_stats, "awakening")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_sleeping_token, "awakening", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_sleeping_token, "awakening")`

- anger near the limit is awaken/alerted entity (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_sleeping_token_stats, "alerted")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_sleeping_token, "alerted", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_sleeping_token, "alerted")`


Like the [submerged entity]{.smallcaps}, the [sleeping organism]{.smallcaps} highlights the way anger is brought about, but utilising a different image, namely alerting or awakening an inactive organism. The conventionalised lexical unit of this metaphor is based on the root *pancing* 'lure a fish using a bite; to fish for sth.' and *bangkit* 'wake/get up'. Example (@bangunkan_macan) in [Section \@ref(awakening-typebased)](#awakening-typebased) has shown that this metaphor motivates a common proverb for anger in Indonesian that relates to awakening a sleeping tiger.

### [Anger is natural force]{.smallcaps} {#naturalforce-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-naturalforce-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_naturalforce_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "natural force")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "_"), "key", "no"))
mapping_naturalforce_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_naturalforce_token)
mapping_naturalforce_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'natural force') %>% left_join(mapping_naturalforce_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_naturalforce_token_stats)
naturalforce_frame_stats <- happyr::get_frames("natural force", df = marah, frame_var = "SFRAME", metaphor_var = "CM_BROADER", lexunit_var = "MP")
```

The metaphor occupies nearly similar rank in the two datasets (i.e., `r get_metaphor_salience_rank(metaphor_typebased_salience, "natural")` in the type-based dataset and `r get_metaphor_salience_rank(metaphor_salience, "natural")` in the token-based one). This metaphor is predominantly composed of metaphorical patterns evoking frames within the [harm]{.smallcaps} family, particularly sub-cases of the [destroying]{.smallcaps} frame, namely [natural disaster]{.smallcaps} (type=`r pull(filter(naturalforce_frame_stats, str_detect(frames, 'natural disaster')), type)`; token=`r pull(filter(naturalforce_frame_stats, str_detect(frames, 'natural disaster')), n)`) and [destructive natural process]{.smallcaps} (type=`r pull(filter(naturalforce_frame_stats, str_detect(frames, 'destructive')), type)`; token=`r pull(filter(naturalforce_frame_stats, str_detect(frames, 'destructive')), n)`). The other minor source frames are [non-translational motion]{.smallcaps} (type=`r pull(filter(naturalforce_frame_stats, str_detect(frames, 'translational')), type)`; token=`r pull(filter(naturalforce_frame_stats, str_detect(frames, 'translational')), n)`) and [weather]{.smallcaps} (type=`r pull(filter(naturalforce_frame_stats, str_detect(frames, 'weather')), type)`; token=`r pull(filter(naturalforce_frame_stats, str_detect(frames, 'weather')), n)`). Together, the metaphorical patterns of these frames evoke `r happyr::numbers2words(get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, "n_mapping", 'natural'))` mappings.

Key mapping(s): `r get_key_mappings(mapping_naturalforce_token)`

- degree of effect is amount of destructive force (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_naturalforce_token_stats, "degree of effect")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_naturalforce_token, "degree of effect", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_naturalforce_token, "degree of effect")`

- experiencing anger is being destroyed (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_naturalforce_token_stats, "being destroyed")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_naturalforce_token, "being destroyed", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_naturalforce_token, "being destroyed")`

- causing anger to cease is reducing the amount of the disaster (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_naturalforce_token_stats, "reducing")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_naturalforce_token, "reducing", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_naturalforce_token, "reducing")`

- ceasing anger is ceasing amount of force (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_naturalforce_token_stats, "ceasing anger")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_naturalforce_token, "ceasing anger", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_naturalforce_token, "ceasing anger")`
  
The [natural force]{.smallcaps} metaphor mainly focuses on the intensity of the effect of the natural force, as evident by the productivity of this mapping. This is a more specific and different way of construing harmful effect of anger than the other [harm]{.smallcaps}-related metaphor based on different frames within the same family ([Section \@ref(harm-tokenbased)](#harm-tokenbased)).



### [Anger is subjugator]{.smallcaps} {#subjugator-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-subjugator-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_subjugator_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "subjugator")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "_"), "key", "no"))
mapping_subjugator_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_subjugator_token)
mapping_subjugator_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'subjugator') %>% left_join(mapping_subjugator_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_subjugator_token_stats)
subjugator_frame_stats <- happyr::get_frames("subjugator", df = marah, frame_var = "SFRAME", metaphor_var = "CM_BROADER", lexunit_var = "MP")
```

The [subjugator]{.smallcaps} metaphor is mainly based on the correspondence between anger and the Subjugator frame-role in the MN [servitude]{.smallcaps} frame. It is an alias to the [social superior]{.smallcaps} or [social force]{.smallcaps} metaphors proposed in the literature [@kovecses_metaphor_2000, 21, 70]. Kövecses [-@kovecses_metaphor_2000, 71] argues that this metaphor involves asymmetric control-relation between the social inferior (the Subjugated role in the [servitude]{.smallcaps} frame), namely the emoter/self (or its associates), and the social superior (Subjugator), namely the emotion itself. The authority element is incorporated into the [servitude]{.smallcaps} frame from the structure of the MN [authority]{.smallcaps} frame, which in turn is the sub-case of the [control]{.smallcaps} frame. There are `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, col_names = 'n_mapping', 'subjugator')` mappings in this metaphor, evoked by `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, col_names = 'n_type', 'subjugator')` types for the total `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, col_names = 'n_token', 'subjugator')` tokens.

Key mapping(s): `r get_key_mappings(mapping_subjugator_token)`

- effect of and losing control over anger is being subjugated (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_subjugator_token_stats, "being subjugated")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_subjugator_token, "being subjugated", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_subjugator_token, "being subjugated")`

- managing anger is exercise domination over the subjugator (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_subjugator_token_stats, "domination")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_subjugator_token, "domination", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_subjugator_token, "domination")`

- angry person is inferior object of anger (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_subjugator_token_stats, "inferior object")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_subjugator_token, "inferior object", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_subjugator_token, "inferior object")`

The type-based dataset does not reveal the use of this metaphor for [anger]{.smallcaps}. The main meaning focus of this metaphor is on the emotional effect of anger (e.g., being irrational), which is construed via the degree of control and power the authority has over the subjugated. This focus is manifested as the predominant mapping in the metaphor. There is only a small number of types that evoke the self's attempt to manage anger (i.e., exercise/compromising control).

### [Anger is biological entity]{.smallcaps} {#biologicalentity-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-biological-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_biological_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "biological entity")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "_"), "key", "no"))
mapping_biological_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_biological_token)
mapping_biological_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'biological entity') %>% left_join(mapping_biological_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_biological_token_stats)
biological_frame_stats <- happyr::get_frames("biological entity", df = marah, frame_var = "SFRAME", metaphor_var = "CM_BROADER", lexunit_var = "MP")
```


The [biological entity]{.smallcaps} metaphor has relatively low tokens (`r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, "n_token", "biological")`) and sits pretty low in the top-20 salience metaphor (rank `r get_metaphor_salience_rank(metaphor_salience, 'biological')`). However, it is expressed by relatively varied metaphorical patterns (`r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, "n_type", "biological")` types out of `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, "n_token", "biological")` tokens) and elaborate mappings (`r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, "n_mapping", "biological")`). The followings are mappings postulated from the metaphorical patterns. 

- anger leading to other effects is the root/base/seed of an organism from which sth. grows (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_biological_token_stats, "root\\/base\\/seed")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_biological_token, "root\\/base\\/seed", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_biological_token, "root\\/base\\/seed")`
  
- anger as a consequence of an event is fruits/yields of a plant (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_biological_token_stats, "fruits\\/yields")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_biological_token, "fruits\\/yields", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_biological_token, "fruits\\/yields")`

- cause of anger is the seed/source of an organism (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_biological_token_stats, "seed\\/source")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_biological_token, "seed\\/source", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_biological_token, "seed\\/source")`

- the presence of anger is the growth/birth of the organism (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_biological_token_stats, "growth\\/birth")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_biological_token, "growth\\/birth", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_biological_token, "growth\\/birth")`

- effect of anger is plants creeping out (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_biological_token_stats, "creeping out")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_biological_token, "creeping out", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_biological_token, "creeping out")`

- maintaining anger is fertilising the organism/plant (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_biological_token_stats, "fertilising")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_biological_token, "fertilising", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_biological_token, "fertilising")`

As can be seen, no single mapping could be singled out as predominant. The metaphorical patterns utilise different components of the structure of the [organism]{.smallcaps} frame family (e.g., [plant life cycle]{.smallcaps} and [animate entity]{.smallcaps}) to highlight different aspects of [anger]{.smallcaps}. For instance, [anger]{.smallcaps} can be considered as a consequence of an event, or as a cause leading to another effect. The metaphor also includes patterns referring to the cause, existence, and effect of [anger]{.smallcaps}.


### [Anger is (un)veiled object]{.smallcaps} {#unveiled-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-hidden-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_hidden_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "veiled object")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "_"), "key", "no"))
mapping_hidden_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_hidden_token)
mapping_hidden_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'veiled object') %>% left_join(mapping_hidden_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_hidden_token_stats)
hidden_frame_stats <- happyr::get_frames("veiled object", df = marah, frame_var = "SFRAME", metaphor_var = "CM_BROADER", lexunit_var = "MP")
```


This metaphor is attested in the two datasets and occupies the lower rank in the top-20 tables (rank `r get_metaphor_salience_rank(metaphor_salience, 'veiled')` in the token-based dataset, and rank `r get_metaphor_salience_rank(metaphor_typebased_salience, 'veiled')` in the type-based one). In this metaphor, [anger]{.smallcaps} is construed as an object that the experiencer has control over in order to be either displayed (i.e., expressed for others to perceive), or keep it hidden, hence perceptually inaccessible by others. These two inferences, which are re-cast as the mappings in the metaphor, are based on the [hiding]{.smallcaps} and [cause to see]{.smallcaps} frames evoked by the metaphorical patterns.

Key mappings: `r get_key_mappings(mapping_hidden_token)`

- expressing anger is unveiling an object (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_hidden_token_stats, "expressing")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_hidden_token, "expressing", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_hidden_token, "expressing")`

- suppressing anger is hiding/protecting an object (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_hidden_token_stats, "suppressing")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_hidden_token, "suppressing", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_hidden_token, "suppressing")`


The main focus of this metaphor in the token-based dataset is on the externalisation or "unveiling" the anger as shown by the higher type and token frequencies of this mapping compared to the hiding of the object mapping. In contrast, in the type-based dataset ([Section \@ref(hidden-typebased)](#hidden-typebased)) it is the mapping referring to the suppression of anger (i.e., maintaining control by "hiding" the object) that is predominant. Overall, the [(un)veiled object]{.smallcaps} metaphor highlights the issue of control and expression of [anger]{.smallcaps}.


### [Anger is physical contact/harm]{.smallcaps} {#harm-tokenbased}

The metaphor is a sub-case of the [emotional effect is physical contact]{.smallcaps} metaphor proposed by Lakoff and Johnson [@lakoff_metaphors_1980, 50]. It is part of the [force-dynamic]{.smallcaps} system of emotion metaphor [@kovecses_metaphor_2000, 83-85]. The metaphorical patterns evoke the [physical harm]{.smallcaps} frame capture the effect of [anger]{.smallcaps} as impacting both the experiencer and other entities that become the target of angry person, especially when the harmed entity role of the frame is filled with entity other than the experiencer of anger. The following are mappings postulated from the metaphor.

```{r mapping-harm-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_harm_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "harm$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "_"), "key", "no"))
mapping_harm_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_harm_token)
mapping_harm_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'harm$') %>% left_join(mapping_harm_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_harm_token_stats)
harm_frame_stats <- happyr::get_frames("harm$", df = marah, frame_var = "SFRAME", metaphor_var = "CM_BROADER", lexunit_var = "MP")
```

Key mappings: `r get_key_mappings(mapping_harm_token)`

- effect of anger is harmful effect (at others) (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_harm_token_stats, "harmful effect")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_harm_token, "harmful effect", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_harm_token, "harmful effect")`

- experiencing anger is physical harm (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_harm_token_stats, "experiencing")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_harm_token, "experiencing", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_harm_token, "experiencing")`


In Kövecses's [-@kovecses_metaphor_2000] [force-dynamic]{.smallcaps} system, the metaphor highlight predominantly the part where the experience of anger leads to experiencer's responses (e.g., directing the harm at others). This highlighted aspect is also an important part of the [anger is natural force]{.smallcaps}, [anger is subjugator]{.smallcaps}, and [anger is weapon]{.smallcaps} metaphor.

The [contact/harm]{.smallcaps} metaphor is also attested in the type-based dataset and ranks in the top-3 of the type-based salience table ([Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-type-based)](#metaphor-table-type-based)), unlike in the token-based salience table. An interesting difference is that in the type-based dataset, the predominant types focuses the cause of anger. The expressions referring to physical touching or harm are used in the context of harming the candidate experiencer (i.e., causing the candidate experiencer to be angry) ([Section \@ref(harm-typebased)](#harm-typebased)). In the token-based dataset, however, the physical harm expressions are used in the context of showing the harmful effect when experiencing anger and when targeting that effect to others.

### [Intensity is luminousity]{.smallcaps} {#luminousity-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-luminousity-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_luminousity_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "luminousity$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "_"), "key", "no"))
mapping_luminousity_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_luminousity_token)
mapping_luminousity_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'luminousity$') %>% left_join(mapping_luminousity_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_luminousity_token_stats)
luminousity_frame_stats <- happyr::get_frames("luminousity$", df = marah, frame_var = "SFRAME", metaphor_var = "CM_BROADER", lexunit_var = "MP")
```

In the bottom five of the top-20 token-based metaphors ([Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-token-based)](#metaphor-table-token-based)), [intensity is luminousity]{.smallcaps} has the highest token (`r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, 'n_token', 'luminousity$')`) but also the lowest types (`r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, 'n_type', 'luminousity$')`) and mappings (`r get_salience_stats(metaphor_salience, 'n_mapping', 'luminousity$')`). Moreover, the metaphor is not attested in the type-based dataset. These are the metaphorical mappings.

The key mappings: `r get_key_mappings(mapping_luminousity_token)`

- reducing anger is reducing the level of light (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_luminousity_token_stats, "reducing")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_luminousity_token, "reducing", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_luminousity_token, "reducing")`

The metaphor is based on lexical units evoking the [darkness]{.smallcaps} frame in MN, a perspective of the [luminosity]{.smallcaps} frame that characterises the amount of light from a light source. The frames are utilised in highlighting the ceasing intensity of anger. In this way, [intensity is luminousity]{.smallcaps} is related to the [anger is fire]{.smallcaps} ([Section \@ref(fire-tokenbased)](#fire-tokenbased)) but captures anger's intensity not via the degree of heat of fire, but via the amount of light.

### [Anger is person]{.smallcaps} {#person-tokenbased}

```{r mapping-person-token, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_person_token <- filter(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "person$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "_"), "key", "no"))
mapping_person_token_stats <- get_metaphor_mapping_stat_typefreq(mapping_person_token)
mapping_person_token_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_tokenbased_mapping, 'person$') %>% left_join(mapping_person_token %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_person_token_stats)
person_frame_stats <- happyr::get_frames("person$", df = marah, frame_var = "SFRAME", metaphor_var = "CM_BROADER", lexunit_var = "MP")
```

This metaphor could be considered as a soft personification of [anger]{.smallcaps}. Unlike the other personifying metaphors, such as [adversary]{.smallcaps} or [subjugator]{.smallcaps}, [anger is person]{.smallcaps} captures the causation and diminishing of anger, rather than the intensity and effect of it (see the mappings below). It is based on lexical units that evoke features of the MN [person]{.smallcaps} frame, which is a sub-case of the [animate entity]{.smallcaps} and [sentient]{.smallcaps} frames. 

Key mappings: `r get_key_mappings(mapping_person_token)`

- causing anger is inviting a person to come (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_person_token_stats, "inviting")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_person_token, "inviting", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_person_token, "inviting")`

- experiencing anger is being friend with/welcome by a person (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_person_token_stats, "friend")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_person_token, "friend", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_person_token, "friend")`

- reducing anger is dismissing the invited person (type=`r get_metaphor_mapping_n_lu(mapping_person_token_stats, "dismissing")`; token=`r get_metaphor_mapping_tokenfreq(mapping_person_token, "dismissing", lu_output = FALSE)`)

  - `r get_lu_gloss_n_printed(mapping_person_token, "dismissing")`

The metaphorical patterns refer to actions and objectives that animate as well as sentient/cognising entities such as a person typically do. These includes welcoming, inviting, dismissing, and befriend or playing with someone. In a way, such actions represent anger as a superficially safe emotion to be with.

```{r metonymy-category-table-tokenbased}
metonymy_tokenbased_category_binomtest_type <- binom.test(sum(filter(metonymy_tokenbased_salience_category, category != "physiological response")$n_type), sum(sum(filter(metonymy_tokenbased_salience_category, category != "physiological response")$n_type), sum(filter(metonymy_tokenbased_salience_category, category == "physiological response")$n_type)))

metonymy_tokenbased_category_binomtest_token <- binom.test(sum(filter(metonymy_tokenbased_salience_category, category != "physiological response")$n_token), sum(sum(filter(metonymy_tokenbased_salience_category, category != "physiological response")$n_token), sum(filter(metonymy_tokenbased_salience_category, category == "physiological response")$n_token)))

metonymy_tokenbased_category_print %>% knitr::kable(caption = "Two types of metonymies of [anger]{.smallcaps} (token-based dataset)")
```

As in the type-based dataset ([Section \@ref(metonymy-category-typebased)](#metonymy-category-typebased)), the number of metonymies in the physiological response category are greater than the ones in the social-communicative behaviour. However, the social-communicative behaviour category in total still exhibits significantly greater number of types (*p*~Binomial~ ~two~~-~~tailed~`r pval_print(metonymy_tokenbased_category_binomtest_type$p.value)`) and tokens (*p*~Binomial~ ~two~~-~~tailed~`r pval_print(metonymy_tokenbased_category_binomtest_token$p.value)`) than the physiological response category. So the type-based and token-based datasets converge along these distributional aspects of the metonymies.


# Metonymical basis of [anger]{.smallcaps} metaphors {#metonymic-basis}

- Metonymical basis of the metaphors (as can be found, e.g., in Lakoff and Kövecses 1987; attached). Please explain in this section any possible metonymy that motivates [anger]{.smallcaps} metaphors.

# Cultural model of [anger]{.smallcaps} {#cultural-model}

- Schematic (prototypical) characterization of the cultural model of [anger]{.smallcaps}, as indicated by uncovered source domains in the respective language. Please follow similar structure as that depicted for the “cognitive model of emotion” in Kövecses (2015: 84-85).

# The role of context {#contexts}

- Influence of the context (see Kövecses 2019b; attached) on the metaphors and cultural model. Please elaborate by focusing on the following four subsections:

- See James J. Fox (2018) study on emotion in Rotenese of eastern Indonesia where he discusses social context of the linguistic usage of emotion metaphors

## Situational context {#situational-context}

## Discourse context {#discourse-context}

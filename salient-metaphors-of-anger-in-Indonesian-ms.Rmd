# Introduction {#intro}

Indonesian (or *Bahasa Indonesia*) is the standardised and official variety of the Malay language used in the multilingual society of Indonesia; the other standard forms of Malay also serve as the national languages of Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore [@tadmor_malay-indonesian_2009, 791]. Malay-Indonesian has the largest speakers in South-east Asia, with almost 280 million speakers combined in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei [@tadmor_malay-indonesian_2009, 791; @adelaar_dialects_2017, 571]. Genetically, Malay-Indonesian belongs to the Austronesian language family, particularly to "the Malayic subgroup of Western Malayo-Polynesian" [@tadmor_malay-indonesian_2009, 791; @adelaar_dialects_2017, 571]. For centuries, Malay-Indonesian has been the "lingua franca" in the regions and developed the colloquial varieties that exhibit great differences among themselves and with the standard language in many aspects of linguistic structures, from phonology to pragmatics [@tadmor_malay-indonesian_2009, 793]. This paper investigates the conceptualisations of [anger]{.smallcaps} in the standard Indonesian based on databases from the *Indonesian Leipzig Corpora* (hereafter ILC) collection [@biemann_leipzig_2007; @goldhahn_building_2012; @quasthoff_indonesian_2013], the Indonesian thematic thesaurus, the Indonesian WordNet, an Indonesian monolingual dictionary, and a bilingual Indonesian-English dictionary ([Section \@ref(method)](#method)).

## Previous studies on emotion concepts in Indonesian {#previous-study-emotion}

The EMOTION domain in Indonesian have been studied from the experimental psychological, ethnographical, and linguistic perspectives. Heider [-@heider_landscapes_1991] analysed large clusters of emotion concepts, including [anger]{.smallcaps} (see [Section \@ref(previous-study-anger)](#previous-study-anger)), based on 200 emotion words. The goals of Heider's study are twofold: (i) to map out the connection between emotion words of Minangkabau language spoken in West Sumatera and of Indonesian as spoken by the Minangkabau community and the Javanese community; and (ii) to identify prototypical scenarios of the emotions related to the behavioural correlates appropriate to various emotions, including the cause/antecedents and the outcomes/expressions of emotions. The study is based on a starter-list of Indonesian emotion words culled from dictionary, novels, and picture description task, and the synonyms of these words given by the respondents [@heider_landscapes_1991, 24-25]. The two points discussed by Heider provide important starting points for the lexical inventory and clusters of emotion words (both literal and figurative) and the cognitive models of the emotions based on different methodology. Heider's [-@heider_cultural_2011] follow-up study utilised open-ended interviews and focus-group discussion to gain richer data on the ethnographically complex construal of emotions clusters identified in Heider [-@heider_landscapes_1991] and situate them in the context of folk psychology. More recent anthropological linguistic studies of emotions in the regional, Austronesian languages of (Western and Eastern) Indonesia can be found in the collection of papers in Fox [-@fox_expressions_2018].

Shaver et al. [-@shaver_structure_2001] is a psychological study on Indonesian emotion lexicons. They adopt the prototype approach and cluster analysis (based on sorting task) to determine the hierarchical and family-resemblance structure of Indonesian emotion concepts, and compare them with findings from American English. Shaver et al. found that American English and Indonesian exhibit similarity in conceptualising the emotion domain and lexicons at the superordinate level (i.e., positive and negative emotion clusters) [-@shaver_structure_2001, 215-216] and basic-level categories (i.e., Indonesian's prototypical terms for the five basic-level categories of emotions refer to the same categories as in American English, namely *cinta* [love], *senang* [happiness], *marah* [anger], *kawatir/takut* [anxiety/fear], and *sedih* [sadness] [-@shaver_structure_2001, 218]).

There are several classic linguistic works on emotions in Indonesian/Malay and related languages. Matisoff [-@matisoff_hearts_1986] studies Sino-Tibetan languages of South-East Asian and highlights a subset of linguistic expressions that he calls "psycho-collocations" of emotions. These collocations are multiword, lexico-semantic metaphoric expressions referring to various kinds of mental activities and personhood, and which component parts are coming from body-part terms. Huang [-@huang_tsou_2002] investigates the psycho-collocation in Tsou, a Tsouic branch of the Austronesian family spoken in the highlands of Southwest Taiwan, and found that *koyu* 'ear' is the body part for the seat of cognition and feeling [@huang_tsou_2002, 171]. Extensive repertoires of psycho-collocations, especially for words referring to 'liver', can be found in Indonesian/Malay [@siahaan_did_2008;  @goddard_contrastive_2008; @oey_psycho-collocations_1990] and Iban (a Malayic language) [@sather_work_2018; @fox_towards_2018, 12]; liver is the prominent seat of feelings, cognition, and personhood in the Malay world. This study will offer some psycho-collocation data regarding to [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian.

Musgrave [-@musgrave_nonsubject_2001] and Mulyadi [-@mulyadi_verba_2012] are linguistic doctoral theses investigating emotion predicates in Indonesian. Based on observational data from an Indonesian novel, Musgrave [-@musgrave_nonsubject_2001] focuses on the syntactic properties of emotion predicates, particularly the grammatical status assigned to the second argument of emotion predicates, and the implication of such analysis to the *Lexical Functional Grammar* theory. One relevant insight from Musgrave's [-@musgrave_nonsubject_2001] study is the range of construction types in which an emotion predicate can occur, which is useful for the methodology used in this chapter in determining the nominal vs. non-nominal usage of [anger]{.smallcaps} predicate. Mulyadi's [-@mulyadi_verba_2012] dissertation is a contrastive semantic studies on emotion verbs between Indonesian and Asahan Malay variety spoken in Tanjungbalai (Asahan) area in the east coast of North Sumatera, Indonesia. Mulyadi uses a variety of methods for collecting the spoken and written data: introspection from the researcher, interview, and written texts of novels, newspapers, and dictionary of Indonesian (KBBI). Based on the *Role and Reference Grammar* and the *Natural Semantic Metalanguage* (NSM) theories, Mulyadi investigated extensive issues, namely (i) formal/syntactic and semantic parameters in determining the inclusion of emotion verbs; (ii) construction types of the emotion verbs in relation to the syntactic mapping of the experiencer (i.e., subject-experiencer, object-experiencer, and dative-experiencer) and the cause of emotions; (iii) categorisation of the emotion verbs (e.g., static vs. active emotion verbs); and (iv) sub-categorisation and meanings of the emotion verbs, based on the NSM explications. Mulyadi's [-@mulyadi_verba_2012] findings on the emotion lexicons and their semantic characterisation, especially on [anger]{.smallcaps}-like emotion, will offer important insights for the current study on the conceptualisation of [anger]{.smallcaps}.

Lastly, the Indonesian emotion concepts have also been analysed in terms of their metaphorical conceptualisations based on the *Conceptual Metaphor Theory* (CMT) [@siahaan_did_2008; @siahaan_why_2015; @rajeg_metafora_2013; @rajeg_metaphorical_2019]. Siahaan [-@siahaan_did_2008] examines the cultural conceptualisations and cultural models of the Indonesian word *hati* 'liver', which is the seat of emotion and cognition in the Malay/Indonesian culture. She proposes two underlying motives for the conceptualisations of Indonesian *hati* 'liver', namely the liver divination ritual and ethno-religious belief *hati* 'liver' as the locus for the living soul [see also @goddard_contrastive_2008 for a contrastive analysis of the conceptualisation of *hati* 'liver' in Malaysian Malay and the English *heart* from the NSM perspective]. Siahaan's [-@siahaan_why_2015] follow-up study investigates the figurative extensions of Indonesian terms for TEMPERATURE and found that emotion is a predominant extended sense of these terms. From the target-domain perspective, Rajeg [-@rajeg_metafora_2013] is the first study applying quantitative, corpus-based method to study metaphors for five Indonesian basic-level emotion concepts, including [anger]{.smallcaps} (see [Section \@ref(previous-study-anger)](#previous-study-anger)), based on self-compiled, literary corpus data. Rajeg's [-@rajeg_metafora_2013] analytical aspects include (i) identifying emotion-specific metaphors [@kovecses_emotionspecific_1998] using a statistical technique of *Configural Frequency Analysis* (CFA) [@gries_statistics_2009], and (ii) how these specific metaphors and their main meaning foci [@kovecses_metaphor_2010] semantically distinguish the emotions between one another. Rajeg [-@rajeg_metaphorical_2019] is a quantitative corpus-based study on metaphors for HAPPINESS near-synonyms that adopts the *MetaNet* approach to CMT [for a recent overview, see @oana_computational_2017; and the collection of papers in @petruck_metanet_2016] and *Metaphorical Pattern Analysis* (MPA) [@stefanowitsch_happiness_2004; @stefanowitsch_words_2006]. One of the themes in Rajeg's [-@rajeg_metaphorical_2019] study is investigating distinctive metaphors distinguishing emotion near-synonyms by applying *Multiple Distinctive Collexeme Analysis* (MDCA). Rajeg [-@rajeg_metaphorical_2019] identified that metaphors strongly distinguishing *happiness* and *joy* in English [@stefanowitsch_happiness_2004; @stefanowitsch_words_2006] are also amongst the metaphors strongly distinguishing the Indonesian equivalences of *happiness*, namely *kebahagiaan*, and of *joy*, namely *kegembiraan*.

## Previous studies on [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian {#previous-study-anger}
  
[Anger]{.smallcaps} concept in particular has also been part of the previous studies discussed in [Section \@ref(previous-study-emotion)](#previous-study-emotion). Heider [-@heider_landscapes_1991, 57, Table 7] found that figurative expressions (i.e., *palak* 'stifling; angry' and *panas hati* 'lit. hot liver; angry') received higher rating than the literal expression (i.e. *marah*) to represent [anger]{.smallcaps}, suggesting a potentially higher prominence of the figurative expressions of [anger]{.smallcaps}. Heider [-@heider_landscapes_1991, 24-25] also proposed four [anger]{.smallcaps}-like clusters in Minangkabau Indonesian: (i) "anger" clusters (*naik darah* 'lit. rising blood; angry'), (ii) "anger/cruel" clusters (*bengis* 'cruel; harsness'), (iii) "anger/dislike" clusters (*gemas* 'irritated'), and (iv) "anger/trembling" clusters (*gemetar* 'trembling'). The elicited scenarios from words belonging to the second, "anger/cruel" clusters revealed that the antecedents, or cause, of [anger]{.smallcaps} "are hurtful acts by others, especially naughty children, and the outcomes are physical violence and verbal abuse" [@heider_landscapes_1991, 80, 116]^[The cause of [anger]{.smallcaps} can also be fed by words in the "annoyance" clusters [@heider_landscapes_1991, 81]]. However, Heider [-@heider_landscapes_1991, 80] further noted that in the actual (rather than elicited) behaviour, Indonesians "mask most anger, and the open expression of anger is strongly disapproved of and negatively sanctioned". The Javanese Indonesian respondents describe the masking of [anger]{.smallcaps} more prominently than the Minangkabau Indonesian. It is interesting to see how prominent this expression/suppression aspect of [anger]{.smallcaps} is from the corpus study. Overall, Heider's [-@heider_landscapes_1991] study is a fundamental work in the study of cognitive model of [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian varieties as it provides inventory and relationship of the lexical items in the [anger]{.smallcaps} clusters [@heider_landscapes_1991, 252-258] and the cause-response scenarios of the [anger]{.smallcaps} clusters [@heider_landscapes_1991, 258-263] that can be further checked with corpus study.

Rajeg's [-@rajeg_metafora_2013, 211-213] Configural Frequency Analyses reveal that eight (out of the total 88) metaphors are significantly attracted to *amarah/kemarahan* 'anger' and six metaphors are significantly repelled by *amarah/kemarahan* 'anger'. The attracted metaphors are [controlling emotion is controlling a moving object]{.smallcaps} (N=75)^[The letter "N" inside a bracket represents observed, token frequency of a conceptualisation.], [emotion is pressurised substance]{.smallcaps} (N=95), [emotion is fluid in a container]{.smallcaps} (N=42), [emotion is heated fluid in a container]{.smallcaps} (N=30), [emotion is fire]{.smallcaps} (N=50), ([intensity of]{.smallcaps}) [emotion is temperature]{.smallcaps} ([hot/cold]{.smallcaps}) (N=16), ([intensity of]{.smallcaps}) [emotion is verticality]{.smallcaps} ([high/low]{.smallcaps}) (N=27), and [emotion is natural forces]{.smallcaps} (N=60). The six metaphors repelled by [anger]{.smallcaps} are [emotion is a possessable object]{.smallcaps} (N=23), [causing emotion is object transfer]{.smallcaps} (N=8), [emotion is an accidental motion]{.smallcaps} (N=0), [emotion is a journey]{.smallcaps} (N=0), [becoming emotion is finding an object]{.smallcaps} (N=0), and [emotion is liquid]{.smallcaps} (N=0) [-@rajeg_metafora_2013, 213-214]. The statistical attraction of [anger]{.smallcaps} to the [heat]{.smallcaps}- and [substance]{.smallcaps}-related metaphors in Indonesian seems to reflect the universality and centrality of these metaphors for [anger]{.smallcaps} as suggested in previous studies on different languages [see @kovecses_concept_2000 for details], including most notably English [@stefanowitsch_words_2006; @holland_cognitive_1987]. Most of the attracted metaphors semantically highlight the intensity of [anger]{.smallcaps}. The present study revisits Rajeg's findings via a combination of different methods, namely the lexical and corpus-based approaches as well as the metaphorical salience approach [@kovecses_salience_2015], which does not include comparison with other emotion concepts as in Rajeg's [-@rajeg_metafora_2013] and Stefanowitsch's [-@stefanowitsch_words_2006] studies. Rajeg's quantitative corpus-based study also fills a substantial gap from Yuditha's [-@yuditha_indonesian_2013] study on [anger]{.smallcaps} metaphors in Indonesian. Yuditha [-@yuditha_indonesian_2013] adopts the corpus-illustrated [@tummers_usage-based_2005] approach and does not provide a quantitative assessment for the specificity of certain metaphors that she introspectively proposed to be applicable to [anger]{.smallcaps} (compared to LOVE and HATERD). A follow-up, yet preliminary, quantitative corpus-based study of Indonesian [anger]{.smallcaps} is Rajeg [-@rajeg_metaphorical_2014], who uses a small sample of ten on-line newspapers retrieved via *WebCorp*^[*WebCorp* can be accessed via https://www.webcorp.org.uk/live/.] (CITATION). It investigates the distinctive metaphorical profiles of five [anger]{.smallcaps} synonyms. The metaphorical profiles are based on the distinctive metaphorical constructions [@stefanowitsch_words_2006] for each synonym identified via MDCA (CITATION). It is found that, overall, 'intensity' is the most prominent aspect highlighted by the metaphorical constructions across the synonyms.
  
## Aims {#aims}

This chapter presents new approaches in the study of [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian from the Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) and corpus linguistic perspective. It combines the updated version of the classic introspective/eclectic approach in CMT, namely the "lexical approach" [@kovecses_lexical_2019], with the corpus linguistic approach to metaphor and metonymy [see @stefanowitsch_corpus-based_2006 for an overview; and the collection of papers in @stefanowitsch_gries_2006]. Such combination is reflected in the recent salience-based approach [@kovecses_salience_2015] to measuring the prominent metaphor and metonymy for a given (emotion) target domain in a language (see [Section \@ref(method)](#method) for details of the salience-based approach). The inclusion of metonymy in this chapter fill the gap from previous works in Indonesian that focus only on metaphor [@yuditha_indonesian_2013; @rajeg_metafora_2013; @rajeg_metaphorical_2014]. Finally, this chapter will also discuss the role of contexts in metaphor and metonymy as highlighted in recent development of CMT [@kovecses_metaphormindcontext_2019]. Given the existing works on [anger]{.smallcaps} metaphors in Indonesian, we would expect some common theme in the types of metaphors for [anger]{.smallcaps}, but the new approach adopted in this chapter is expected to enrich the existing description of the conceptualisation of [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian.

The chosen Indonesian terms corresponding to the English "anger" are *marah* 'angry; anger'^[The English translations come from Stevens and Schmidgall-Tellings [-@stevens_comprehensive_2004].], *amarah*^[*Amarah* is the informal variant of *marah* as indicated by the official *Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia* (KBBI) *The Big Dictionary of Indonesian* and defined under the entry for *marah*: https://kbbi.kemdikbud.go.id/entri/marah (accessed on October 26, 2021).] 'anger', and *kemarahan* 'fury; rage; anger', which is the abstract noun derivative from the root *marah*. The choice is based on Shaver et al.'s [-@shaver_structure_2001, 217] experimental finding that *marah* emerges as the prototypical label for the [anger]{.smallcaps}-like category in Indonesian, as it is semantically broader and commonly used in everyday Indonesian. The suggested commonality of *(a)marah* is evident from the frequency data in the ILC. The combined frequency of occurrence of *(a)marah* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(root, lemma == "(a)marah"), n), big.mark = ",")`) is significantly the highest (*X*^2^~goodness-of-fit~=`r format(round(root_chisq$statistic, 1))`; *df*=`r root_chisq$parameter`; *p*~two-tailed~`r root_pvals`) compared to the other two terms identified by Shaver et al [-@shaver_structure_2001, 218, Table 4] belonging to the same [anger]{.smallcaps}-like category, namely *geram* 'furious; angry' (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(root, lemma == "geram"), n), big.mark = ",")`) and *berang* 'furious; fury' (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(root, lemma == "berang"), n), big.mark = ",")`), as well as to the other near-synonyms of *marah* namely *murka* 'wrath; anger; fury' (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(root, lemma == "murka"), n), big.mark = ",")`) and *gusar* 'angry; offended; annoyed' (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(root, lemma == "gusar"), n), big.mark = ",")`). Moreover, *ke**marah**an* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(ke_an, lemma == "kemarahan"), n), big.mark = ",")`) as the derivative of *marah* is also highly significantly the most frequent in ILC (*X*^2^~goodness-of-fit~=`r format(round(ke_an_chisq$statistic, 1))`; *df*=`r ke_an_chisq$parameter`; *p*~two-tailed~`r ke_an_pvals`) compared to the other derivatives based on the other roots, namely *ke**murka**an* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(ke_an, lemma == "kemurkaan"), n), big.mark = ",")`), *ke**gusar**an* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(ke_an, lemma == "kegusaran"), n), big.mark = ",")`), *ke**geram**an* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(ke_an, lemma == "kegeraman"), n), big.mark = ",")`), and *ke**berang**an* (N=`r prettyNum(pull(filter(ke_an, lemma == "keberangan"), n), big.mark = ",")`).


The database for the type-based, lexical approach is culled from the Indonesian WordNet (version 1.0) [@bond_wordnet_2014]^[The Indonesian WordNet 1.0 is available open access online at http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/cgi-bin/wn-gridx.cgi?usrname=&gridmode=wnbahasa (last accessed on 22 January 2022.)], the monolingual *Kamus Bahasa Indonesia* (the Indonesian Dictionary) (hereafter KBI) [@kamus_bi_2008]^[I used the full and searchable PDF version.], the official *Tesaurus Tematis Bahasa Indonesia* (the Indonesian Thematic Thesaurus) (http://tesaurus.kemdikbud.go.id/tematis/)^[The thesaurus is compiled and maintained by the Language Development and Cultivation Agency of the Ministy of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia.], and a bilingual Indonesian-English dictionary [@stevens_comprehensive_2004]. The relevant linguistic expressions (word, phrases) were gathered as follows. From the Indonesian sources (WordNet, KBI, and the thesaurus), the three Indonesian [anger]{.smallcaps} words (*marah*, *amarah*, *kemarahan*) were used as the search terms. This approach allows me to determine which entries/expressions (words, phrases, proverbs, etc.) contain (one of the) [anger]{.smallcaps} terms in their definition. Next, these expressions were checked manually one by one for the conceptualisations (e.g., metaphor or metonymy) and the source domains evoked by looking at their meanings in the online *Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia* (hereafter KBBI) (the Big Indonesian Dictionary)^[I used KBI instead of KBBI because KBBI only outputs the brief definition of the three [anger]{.smallcaps} words but not the metaphorical/metonymical expressions related to them, which can be found through the linked thematic thesaurus in the entry. In contrast, the available full PDF version of KBI allows me to do a concordance-like search throughout the PDF file using the target [anger]{.smallcaps} terms, which may appear in the definition of an entry related to them. This is not possible in KBBI because the search field is only used for the headword, not the words contained in the definition of the headword. That way, we need to know *a priori* all expressions which definitions contain the [anger]{.smallcaps} words.] following the procedure of the *Metaphor Identification Procedure* (MIP) [@pragglejaz_mip_2007; @pragglejaz_mip_2010]. To gather the data from the bilingual Indonesian-English dictionary, the English terms "anger" and "angry" were entered in the search field of the PDF version of the dictionary, allowing me to find the Indonesian expressions which definitions/glosses contain the word "angry" or "anger".

The database for the token-based, corpus approach is taken from the sentence-based corpus files (total size = `r prettyNum(sum(leipzig_size$total_tokens), big.mark = ",")` word-tokens) in the Indonesian Leipzig Corpora (ILC) collection. ILC is chosen since, to the best of my knowledge, it is the only open access source to the largest collection of Indonesian texts^[The alternative is the Indonesian corpus in *Sketch Engine* (SE), which is also from online materials as in ILC. However, SE is a paid service to which I and the institution I work in do not have paid subscription.] and allows us to download the raw corpus files.
The sources of the ILC files mainly consist of randomly chosen websites (`r pull(filter(leipzig_size_sources, sources == "web"), perc_sources)`% of the total size) and online news (`r pull(filter(leipzig_size_sources, sources == "news"), perc_sources)`%), followed by the Wikipedia dumps (`r pull(filter(leipzig_size_sources, sources == "wikipedia"), perc_sources)`%) and a mixture of other sources (`r pull(filter(leipzig_size_sources, sources == "mixed"), perc_sources)`%).

Following the *Metaphorical Pattern Analysis* (MPA) [@stefanowitsch_happiness_2004; @stefanowitsch_words_2006], I generated 1000 random concordance lines for each *marah*, *amarah*, and *kemarahan* to begin with, before manually discarding the irrelevant hits (e.g., duplicates, the predicative and attributive uses of the root *marah*, and the literal uses of the expressions). Next, to identify the relevant pattern, the constructional, syntactic collocations of the target terms were manually determined, adopting the underlying method in the *MetaNet* (MN) project that combines MPA with the construction grammar and frame-semantic approaches to metaphor [@sullivan_frames_2013; @oana_computational_2017; see also @rajeg_metaphorical_2019 for a recent application of MN and MPA to HAPPINESS metaphors in Indonesian; and @brooke-rose_grammar_1958, for the classic study highlighting the interaction of grammar and metaphor]. These collocations become the potential source-domain lexical units (hereafter LU) co-occurring with the target-domain terms in the metaphorical expressions [@stefanowitsch_happiness_2004, 138; @sullivan_frames_2013, 3, 5]. The next step is to adopt the MIP procedure to determine whether the collocation of the target terms evoke metaphorical readings. It is determined as to whether the collocates' contextual meaning when co-occurring with the target-domain terms contrasts with their more basic contemporary meaning in other contexts, such that the "contextual meaning can be understood in comparison to the basic meaning" [@rajeg_metaphorical_2019, 64; cf. @pragglejaz_mip_2007, 3; @sullivan_frames_2013, 36]. I use KBBI to determine the basic meaning of the collocates with reference to MIP's features of basic meaning of an LU, namely "more concrete (what they evoke is easier to imagine, see, hear, feel, smell, and taste), related to bodily action, more precise (as opposed to vague), historically older, and are not necessarily the most frequent meanings" [@pragglejaz_mip_2007, 3]. These features correspond to the characteristics of metaphorical source domains in CMT [@kovecses_where_2015, 2]. An additional diagnostic to help determine the basic meaning of the LUs is a question proposed by Soriano [-@soriano_conceptualization_2005, 91]: "what exactly each expression 'was literally about'?". To illustrate, consider the following examples showing two different ways to convey the existence of [anger]{.smallcaps} (*kemarahan*).

(@kemarahan_terjadi) *Kemarahan Presiden Jokowi __terjadi__ saat meninjau Pelabuhan Tanjung Priok (...)* (ind-id_web_2015_3M: 1310067)^[At the end of the numbered example, the source of the example is given in the format "(corpus file name: sentence id)" as in (ind-id_web_2015_3M: 1310067).]

(@kemarahan_datang) *(...) kemarahan itu bisa saja __datang__ dalam waktu yang ditentukan (...)* (ind-id_web_2013_1M: 143884).

Example (@kemarahan_terjadi) is considered a literal token given the verbal collocate *terjadi* 'happen' represents an abstract event as its basic meaning and, in this collocation with [anger]{.smallcaps} (another abstract domain), *terjadi* is still understood in the abstract domain of [anger]{.smallcaps} [@croft_domain_2003, 192; @sullivan_frames_2013, 9; @rajeg_metaphorical_2019, 99]. In contrast, the collocation of *kemarahan* as the subject of the motion verb *datang* 'come' (@kemarahan_datang), which has a basic meaning in the domain of physical translational motion, induces the metaphorical "domain mapping" [@croft_domain_2003, 192] and interpretation of the verb in the [anger]{.smallcaps} domain [cf. @sullivan_integrating_2016, 147; @dancygier_figurative_2014, 135]. Such metaphoric interpretation of *datang* 'come' emerges due to mismatch between (i) the semantic-type constraint assigned to the semantic role of the subject of *datang*, which is prototypically an animate entity, and (ii) the filler of that role, namely an abstract entity [anger]{.smallcaps} that is literally unable to perform translational motion; in MN, this evocation of metaphorical interpretation of an LU is called "role type constraint violations" [@stickles_formalizing_2016, 194; cf. @sullivan_integrating_2016, 148; @brooke-rose_grammar_1958, 1]. Prior to the MN project, the principles of metaphor-domain evocation of certain linguistic elements in a grammatical construction (e.g., the subject-verb or verb-object constructions) have been described extensively by Sullivan [-@sullivan_frames_2013; -@sullivan_integrating_2016] in terms of the Cognitive Grammar [@langacker_essentials_2013, 199] notion of autonomy/dependence (A/D) alignment in grammatical construction [cf. @rajeg_metaphorical_2019, 63, 101, for the discussion on the relevance of A/D alignment and MPA]. This goes without saying that there are also unclear cases as to whether the tokens are metaphorical or literal; these were marked as "?" in the database and can be viewed in the supplementary materials **(CITATION/DOI of the REPOS)**.

Another aspect of the token-based, data collection is identifying multiple metaphorical patterns in a single concordance line given that the target-domain term can have more than one relevant syntactic collocation [@sullivan_frames_2013, 135-138; @musolff_variation_2014; @rajeg_metaphorical_2019, 63]. Consider example (@multiple_mpattern):

(@multiple_mpattern) *(...) kerusuhan itu merupakan __hasil dari__ amarah yang __menumpuk__ (...)* (ind_news_2010_300K: 83871)

From this one citation of *amarah*, two metaphorical patterns are relevant syntactically. The first one is the noun phrase (NP) *__hasil__ dari amarah* 'the *yield* of anger'. In this NP, the source-domain item *hasil* 'yield' is the head while the target-domain item appears as the complement of the modifying preposition phrase (PP) *dari* 'from'. The second relevant pattern is the relative clause construction *amarah yang __menumpuk__* 'anger that _piles up_/_amasses_' whereby the head noun is the target-domain term while the source-domain item is the verbal head *menumpuk* of the relative clause.

After identifying the metaphorical patterns, they are grouped thematically into their metaphorical source domains. This study adopts the insights of the *MetaNet* (MN) approach to CMT. MN attempts to formalise the central notions in CMT via semantic frames and grammatical constructions by (i) representing the metaphor-input domains as semantic frames, and (ii) viewing conceptual metaphor (hereafter metaphor) as unidirectional mappings from the source-domain frames and to the target-domain frames, including the mapping between the frame roles, that are mediated via the metaphorical grammatical constructions [@sullivan_frames_2013; @stickles_formalizing_2016; @croft_connecting_2009]. The closest English equivalence of the Indonesian metaphorical LUs in the metaphorical patterns is used as guidance to determine the relevant category of source-domain semantic frames in the English MN Wiki repository of semantic frames [cf. @lopez_distinguishing_2011 for a similar Frame-Semantic approach in Spanish]. Such thematic grouping also takes into account the relevant categories postulated in previous studies on [anger]{.smallcaps} metaphors. Furthermore, the metaphorical mappings within a metaphor are postulated by making use of the frame roles available in a given MN frame entry (when available) or proposed anew based on the semantics of the source-domain LUs in the metaphorical patterns. For the metonymic source domains, they are determined by checking the expressions related to the folk theory of the physiological effects of emotion as proposed in previous works.

The *metaphorical salience* measure for a given metaphor in the token-based, corpus database takes into account three variables:

1. The percentage of the token frequency of a metaphor
1. The percentage of the number of types of metaphorical linguistic expressions (i.e., metaphorical patterns) of a metaphor
1. The percentage of the number of types of metaphorical mappings in a metaphor

The token frequency of a metaphor is derived from all occurrences of metaphorical patterns evoking a given metaphor; the percentage of the token frequency for a metaphor is calculated from the total number of metaphorical tokens of all metaphors in the database. The same procedure and logic is applied for calculating the percentages of the types of metaphorical linguistic expressions and the types of metaphorical mappings [see @kovecses_salience_2015, 344-346 for details].

The metaphorical salience measure in the database for the lexical, type-based approach only takes into account the number of types of metaphorical linguistic expressions and the number of metaphorical mappings for a given metaphor. It is because the focus of such an approach is to gather the range of types of metaphorical expressions evoking a given metaphor and the metaphorical mappings within the metaphor.

The analysis on the lexical approach database reveals `r nrow(metaphor_typebased_salience)` types of conceptual metaphors. [Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-type-based)](#metaphor-table-type-based) presents the source domains of the metaphors ranked order by their degree of metaphorical salience measure shown in the `Aggregate` column.

In [Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-type-based)](#metaphor-table-type-based), `r happyr::numbers2words(length(grep(" is ", metaphor_typebased_salience_print[[1]], perl = TRUE)))` metaphors are shown in full, both with the source and target domains because they are the more general metaphors.

### [Anger is fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-animal, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_animal <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "fierce")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_restrained|experiencer_restraining)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_animal_stats <- mapping_animal %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))

The lexical database reveals that [anger]{.smallcaps} is most saliently conceptualised as [fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps}. The [anger is fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps} metaphor is evoked in `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_typebased_salience, "n_type", "fierce, captive")` lexical units manifesting `r happyr::numbers2words(get_salience_stats(metaphor_typebased_salience, "n_mapping", "fierce, captive"))` conceptual correspondences/mappings between [anger]{.smallcaps} and [fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps}:

key mappings:

- anger <- restrained/captive, fierce animal
- experiencer <- entity who restrains/makes captive the animal


The most productive mapping/correspondence (`r mapping_animal_discuss %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING2) %>% unique()`; type = `r mapping_animal_discuss %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu) %>% unique()`)

The second most frequent mapping (`r mapping_animal_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'deliberately')) %>% pull(MAPPING2) %>% unique()`; type = `r mapping_animal_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'deliberately')) %>% pull(n_lu) %>% unique()`)

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_animal_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'losing control')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_animal_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'losing control')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

The least frequent mapping (`r mapping_animal_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'regulating')) %>% pull(MAPPING2) %>% unique()`; type = `r mapping_animal_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'regulating')) %>% pull(n_lu) %>% unique()`)

  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_verticality-scale)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_verticality_stats <- mapping_verticality %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_verticality_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'verticality$') %>% left_join(mapping_verticality %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_verticality_stats)
```

Total types for the [intensity is verticality]{.smallcaps} metaphor is `r pull(filter(metaphor_typebased_salience, metaphor == "intensity of anger is verticality"), n_type)` expressions evoking `r pull(filter(metaphor_typebased_salience, metaphor == "intensity of anger is verticality"), n_mapping)` mappings. The key mapping is intensity of `r mapping_verticality %>% filter(status == 'key') %>% select(MAPPING) %>% distinct() %>% pull(MAPPING) %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ") %>% paste(collapse = "; ")`.

The most productive mapping is `r mapping_verticality_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " -> ")` (type = `r mapping_verticality_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`):

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_verticality_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'upward motion')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_verticality_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'upward motion')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

Another mapping indicates a short-lived, low intensity anger since the linguistic expression conveys the idea that the anger does not reach the end point of the scale (*marah __tiada sampai__* 'short-lived anger; lit. anger not reaching end point of a scale')

The main meaning focus of this metaphor is on the increasing intensity of anger construed via the lexical units evoking the upward motion frame. This is shown by the high-type frequency of the lexical units of the mapping.

### [Anger is contained substance]{.smallcaps}

This is a short-hand label for the [emotion is substance/fluid in a container]{.smallcaps} metaphor. This is part of a larger network of the [substance]{.smallcaps}-related source frames family postulated in the database. The other source domain frames are [heated/hot fluid in a container]{.smallcaps} and [pressurised substance in a container]{.smallcaps} ([Section \@ref(pressurised-1)](#pressurised-1)). The difference between the [contained substance]{.smallcaps} and [heated/hot fluid in a container]{.smallcaps} or [pressurised substance in a container]{.smallcaps} is that the former does not include the heated and pressurised semantics of the frames. The intensity aspect in the [contained substance]{.smallcaps} domain is construed via the quantity of the substance and the expression of anger is construed via the externalisation of the substance.

```{r mapping-containedfluid, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_containedfluid <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "is substance in a container$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_contents/located-entity)") & LU != "darah muda", "key", "no"),
         status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "angry-person_container"), "key", status),
         status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger-level_substance-fullness-level)"), "key", status))
mapping_containedfluid_stats <- mapping_containedfluid %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_containedfluid_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'is substance in a container$') %>% left_join(mapping_containedfluid %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_containedfluid_stats)
```

Total types for the [contained substance]{.smallcaps} is `r pull(filter(metaphor_typebased_salience, metaphor == "anger is substance in a container"), n_type)` expressions evoking `r pull(filter(metaphor_typebased_salience, metaphor == "anger is substance in a container"), n_mapping)` mappings. The key mappings are `r mapping_containedfluid %>% filter(status == 'key') %>% select(MAPPING) %>% distinct() %>% pull(MAPPING) %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ") %>% paste(collapse = "; ")`.

The most productive mapping is `r mapping_containedfluid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)` (type = `r mapping_containedfluid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`):

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_containedfluid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'channeling')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_containedfluid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'channeling')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`


### [Anger is heated fluid in a container]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-hotfluid, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_hotfluid <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "heated")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "angry-person_container"), "key", "no"),
         status = if_else(MAPPING == "anger_(heated-)fluid", "key", status))
mapping_hotfluid_stats <- mapping_hotfluid %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_hotfluid_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'heated') %>% left_join(mapping_hotfluid %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_hotfluid_stats)
```

Key mappings: anger is heated fluid; angry person is the container.

The most productive mapping is `r mapping_hotfluid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type = `r mapping_hotfluid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`):

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_hotfluid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'heat\\-level')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_hotfluid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'heat\\-level')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

Another mapping indicates caused increasing intensity is heating up the fluid (*naik setum* 'steam/fume up').


### [Degree of control is object dimension]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-dimension, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_dimension <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "dimension$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "anger_entity"), "key", "no"))
mapping_dimension_stats <- mapping_dimension %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_dimension_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'dimension$') %>% left_join(mapping_dimension %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_dimension_stats)
```

The [dimension]{.smallcaps} source domain is based on the [size]{.smallcaps}. The smaller the dimension/space of an entity, the harder the angered person control the emotion. This is a difference inference in the use of the frame in construing the intensity level of [anger]{.smallcaps}, which is only found in the corpus-based data.

The key mapping is anger <- physical entity

The prominent mapping is `r mapping_dimension_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type = `r mapping_dimension_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`)

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_dimension_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'narrow')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_dimension_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'narrow')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

### [Anger is natural force]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-naturalforce, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_naturalforce <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "natural force$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "anger_natural-disaster"), "key", "no"))
mapping_naturalforce_stats <- mapping_naturalforce %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_naturalforce_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'natural force$') %>% left_join(mapping_naturalforce %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_naturalforce_stats)
```

This metaphor mainly focus on the intensity of anger construed as the powerful extent of natural forces. This is based on the [natural disaster]{.smallcaps} frame in MetaNet.

Key mapping: anger <- natural disaster

The prominent mapping is on the reduction/ceasing of anger: `r mapping_naturalforce_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type = `r mapping_naturalforce_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`)

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'to cease')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'to cease')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

The other mapping is (`r mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'ceasing')) %>% pull(MAPPING2) %>% unique()`; type = `r mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'ceasing')) %>% pull(n_lu) %>% unique()`):

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'ceasing')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_naturalforce_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'ceasing')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

and intensity of anger is the intensity of the natural force (*angin-anginan* 'windy; capricious; unpredictable')


### [Anger is solid entity]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-solid, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_solid <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "rough, solid entity$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_entity|degree.of.solidity)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_solid_stats <- mapping_solid %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_solid_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'rough, solid entity$') %>% left_join(mapping_solid %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_solid_stats)
```


The key mappings are `r mapping_solid %>% filter(status == "key") %>% pull(MAPPING) %>% unique() %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ") %>% paste(collapse = "; ")`.

The other mappings are: `r mapping_solid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type = `r mapping_solid_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`)

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_solid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'calmness')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_solid_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'calmness')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

Other mapping is the reduction of [anger]{.smallcaps} as melting ice (*mencair* 'to melt').

### [Anger is (un)veiled object]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-hidden, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_hidden <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "veiled object$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "([(]un[)]hidden\\-object)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_hidden_stats <- mapping_hidden %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_hidden_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'veiled object$') %>% left_join(mapping_hidden %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_hidden_stats)
```

The key mapping is `r mapping_hidden %>% filter(status == "key") %>% pull(MAPPING) %>% unique() %>% str_replace_all("[-]", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")`. 

The predominant mapping is `r mapping_hidden_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type = `r mapping_hidden_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`)

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_hidden_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'hiding')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_hidden_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'hiding')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

The other mapping is expressing anger is unveiling a hidden object (e.g., cause to emerge) (*__menerbitkan__ amarah* '(of sun) to *raise* anger')

The metaphor relates to the social expression and degree of control of the experiencer to keep or expose the anger.


### [(Cause of) anger is annoyance]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-annoyance, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_annoyance <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "annoyance$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "([(]un[)]hidden\\-object)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_annoyance_stats <- mapping_annoyance %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_annoyance_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'annoyance$') %>% left_join(mapping_annoyance %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_annoyance_stats)
```

The central mapping is `r mapping_annoyance_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type = `r mapping_annoyance_stats %>% slice_max(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`)

- `r paste(paste("*", mapping_annoyance_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'cause.of')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_annoyance_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'cause.of')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`

The other mapping is `r mapping_annoyance_stats %>% slice_min(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(MAPPING)  %>% str_replace_all("-", " ") %>% str_replace_all("_", " <- ")` (type = `r mapping_annoyance_stats %>% slice_min(order_by = n_lu) %>% pull(n_lu)`) (`r paste(paste("*", mapping_annoyance_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'person.causing')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_annoyance_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'person.causing')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`)

### [Anger is a sleeping organism]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-sleeping, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_sleeping <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "sleeping organism$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_slepping\\-entity$)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_sleeping_stats <- mapping_sleeping %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_sleeping_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'sleeping$') %>% left_join(mapping_sleeping %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_sleeping_stats)
```

This metaphor construes [anger]{.smallcaps} as a calm, sleeping organism with the following mappings:

- anger <- sleeping organism
- causing anger <- awakening/fishing out the organism (*__membangkitkan__ marah* 'to _arouse_ one's anger')
- anger near the limit <- awaken entity (*__bangkit__ amarah* 'anger *rose*')

The [awakening]{.smallcaps} frame underlying this metaphor, and in combination with the [fierce animal]{.smallcaps} frame in [anger is fierce, captive animal]{.smallcaps}, is reflected in the common Indonesian proverb for [anger]:

(@bangunkan_macan) *membangunkan macan tidur* 'to awaken a sleeping tiger'

Here, *membangunkan* 'to awaken; to wake s.b. up' and *tidur* '(a)sleep' evoke the [awakening]{.smallcaps} frame while *macan* 'tiger' evokes the [fierce animal]{.smallcaps} frame. The proverb highlights the danger of invoking anger out of a calm state.

### [Anger is possession]{.smallcaps}

This is not prominent metaphor in the database as it is realised by only one type (*ambil* 'take'):

(@typebased_possession) *Jangan __ambil__ marah* 'Do not _take_ the anger' (Stevens Schimdgal Tellings 2004: 30)

This example means that the person should stay calm by not taking the anger object into his/her possession. The mappings that are inferred from this metaphor are as follows:

- anger <- possessable object
- experiencer <- (candidate) possessor
- becoming angry <- taking/gaining the possessable object

The low salience of [possession]{.smallcaps} family of metaphors for [anger]{.small} is not surprising given that a previous study [@rajeg_metafora_2013, 213-214] found that this metaphor family is strongly repelled by [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian (see [Section \@ref(intro)](#intro)).

### [Anger is darkness]{.smallcaps}

```{r mapping-darkness, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
mapping_darkness <- filter(metaphor_typebased_mapping, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "darkness$")) %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(str_detect(MAPPING, "(anger_darkness$)"), "key", "no"))
mapping_darkness_stats <- mapping_darkness %>% filter(status == 'no') %>% group_by(MAPPING) %>% summarise(n_lu = n_distinct(LU))
mapping_darkness_discuss <- get_mappings(metaphor_typebased_mapping, 'darkness$') %>% left_join(mapping_darkness %>% filter(status=='no') %>% select(LU, LU_GLOSS, MAPPING)) %>% filter(!is.na(LU)) %>% left_join(mapping_darkness_stats)
```

The [darkness]{.smallcaps} frame in the metaphor is used to assess [anger]{.smallcaps} as a negative state [cf. @stefanowitsch_words_2006, 77]. It is evoked by `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_typebased_salience, 'n_type', 'darkness')` types manifesting `r get_salience_stats(metaphor_typebased_salience, 'n_mapping', 'darkness')` mappings:

- anger <- darkness
- person being angry <- person('s body) being in darkness (`r paste(paste("*", mapping_darkness_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'dark.state')) %>% pull(LU), "* '", mapping_darkness_discuss %>% filter(str_detect(MAPPING, 'dark.state')) %>% pull(LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ", ")`)

- `r metaphor_typebased %>% filter(str_detect(CM_BROADER, 'darkness'), LU == "kegelapan") %>% pull(CITATIONS)` (`r metaphor_typebased %>% filter(str_detect(CM_BROADER, 'darkness'), LU == "kegelapan") %>% pull(SOURCES)`: `r metaphor_typebased %>% filter(str_detect(CM_BROADER, 'darkness'), LU == "kegelapan") %>% pull(PAGE_LOCATION)`)


## Metonymy {#typebased-metonymy-salience-results}

In the lexical approach database, I identified `r sum(metonymy_typebased_salience$n_type)` metonymic expressions for [anger]{.smallcaps} grouped under `r nrow(metonymy_typebased_salience)` (conceptual) metonymies. These metonymies are rank-ordered in [Table \@ref(tab:metonymy-table-type-based)](#metonymy-table-type-based) by their number of metonymic expressions.

```{r metonymy-table-type-based}
metonymy_typebased_salience %>% 
  mutate(metonymy = paste("[", metonymy, "]{.smallcaps}", sep = "")) %>% 
  rename(Metonymy = metonymy,
         `Number of types` = n_type,
         `% of types` = n_perc_type) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Conceptual metonymies for [anger]{.smallcaps} (Type-based, lexical approach)")
```


The salience of each metonymy can only be measured in terms of the number of the metonymic expressions (i.e., its metonymic types), given the metonymies only involve a single mapping. The mapping is reflected in the naming of the metonymy in the form of [metonymic source domain FOR metonymic target]{.smallcaps} (or [x FOR y]{.smallcaps} for short), which is different from the naming for conceptual metaphor in the form of [metaphoric target domain IS metaphoric source domain]{.smallcaps} (or [a IS b]{.smallcaps} for short).

### [Strong/aggressive verbal behaviour for anger]{.smallcaps}

The type-based analysis reveals that [`r str_replace(pull(slice_max(metonymy_typebased_salience, order_by = n_type), metonymy), " for anger", "")`]{.smallcaps} is the most predominant metonymic source domain for [anger]{.smallcaps} in Indonesian (*X*^2^~goodness~ ~of~ ~fit~=`r round(chisq.test(metonymy_typebased_salience$n_type)$statistic, digit = 2)`, *df*=`r chisq.test(metonymy_typebased_salience$n_type)$parameter`, *p*=`r format(chisq.test(metonymy_typebased_salience$n_type)$p.value, digit = 3)`), showing the largest inventory of metonymic expressions.

- `r paste(paste("*", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "verbal")), LU), "* '", pull(filter(metonymy_typebased, str_detect(CM_BROADER, "verbal")), LU_GLOSS), "'", sep = ""), collapse = "; ")`


These expressions are mostly verbs encoding the manner of speaking that metonymically points to the internal, emotional state of the speaker. More specifically, when someone speaks in the manner expressed by these expressions, the hearer could infer that the speaker is angry.

metaphor_in_lexical_only_top20 <- setdiff(metaphor_typebased_salience$metaphor, pull(slice_max(metaphor_salience, n = 20, order_by = aggregate), metaphor))

binom_test_metaphor_lexical_and_corpus <- binom.test(c(nrow(metaphor_salience), length(metaphor_typebased_salience$metaphor)))
```


From `r length(metaphor_typebased_salience$metaphor)` metaphors identified in the type-based, lexical approach ([Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-type-based)](#metaphor-table-type-based)), `r round((length(metaphor_in_all_database)/length(metaphor_typebased_salience$metaphor)) * 100, digits = 1)`% (i.e., `r length(metaphor_in_all_database)` metaphors) are also identified in the token-based, corpus approach ([Table \@ref(tab:metaphor-table-token-based)](#metaphor-table-token-based)). The metaphors identified only in the type-based analysis (ordered decreasingly by their salience) are `r paste(paste(paste("[", metaphor_in_lexical_only, "]{.smallcaps} (", metaphor_in_lexical_only_aggregate, "%; rank=", metaphor_in_lexical_only_ranking, ")", sep = "")[1:length(metaphor_in_lexical_only)-1], collapse = ", "), ", and ", paste("[", metaphor_in_lexical_only, "]{.smallcaps} (", metaphor_in_lexical_only_aggregate, "%; rank=", metaphor_in_lexical_only_ranking, ")", sep = "")[length(metaphor_in_lexical_only)], sep = "")`. From the token-based, corpus analysis, `r nrow(metaphor_salience)` metaphors are postulated and this number is significantly greater than the number of metaphors (`r length(metaphor_typebased_salience$metaphor)` types) in the type-based analysis (*p*~Binomial~~,~ ~two~~-~~tailed~ = `r round(binom_test_metaphor_lexical_and_corpus$p.value, digits = 4)`). Around `r round((length(metaphor_in_corpus_only)/nrow(metaphor_salience)) * 100, digits = 1)`% (`r length(metaphor_in_corpus_only)` types) of the token-based metaphors are absent from the type-based database. These results suggest that the corpus-based approach can complement the type-based, lexical approach by offering a higher likelihood to identify more metaphors (CITATION TO STEFANOWITSCH 2006).

The slight difference between the [heat]{.smallcaps} and [temperature]{.smallcaps} source domains for [anger]{.smallcaps} in the databases is as follows. The former focuses on the characteristic of (easily) angered person as relatively always hot, reflected by the linguistic expressions that do not encode any reduction of the heat. Meanwhile, the latter highlights the dynamics of the intensity when feeling angry, which can be reduced (i.e., cooled off) or reaching highest temperature. In the MN frame repository, [heat]{.smallcaps} is a different frame considered as a perspective of the [temperature]{.smallcaps} frame, which covers the range of temperature scale (from hot to cold), and [heat]{.smallcaps} is linked in scalar opposition to the [cold]{.smallcaps} frame.
